<h2>STEPHAN EARLE OF BULLONGNE.</h2>


<p style="margin-top:3em;">
<span class="yearnote">1135. <br />
An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;1.</span>
Stephan earle of Bullongne, the sonne of Stephan erle of Blois, by his
wife Adela, daughter to William Conquerour, came ouer with all speed
after the death of his vncle, and tooke vpon him the gouernement of the
realme of England, partlie through confidence which he had in the
puissance and strength of his brother Theobald earle of Blois, and
partlie by the aid of his brother Henrie bishop of Winchester and abbat
of Glastenburie, although that he with other of the Nobles had sworne
afore to be true vnto the empresse and hir issue as lawfull heires of
king Henrie latelie deceased.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A tempest. <i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i></span>
The same daie that he arriued in England, there chanced a mightie great
tempest of thunder, horrible to heare, and lightning dreadfull to
behold. Now bicause this happened in the winter time, it s&eacute;emed against
nature, and therefore it was the more noted as a foreshewing of some
trouble and calamitie to come.</p>

<p><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" ></a><span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
This Stephan began his reigne ouer the realme of England the second
day
of December, in the yere of our Lord 1135. in the eleuenth yeare of the
emperour Lothair, the sixt of pope Innocentius the second, and about the
xxvii. of Lewes the seuenth, surnamed Crassus king of France, Dauid the
first of that name then reigning in Scotland, &amp; entring into the twelfe
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Mal.</i> <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
of his regiment. He was crowned at Westminster vpon S. Stephans day, by
William archbishop of Canturburie, the most part of the Nobles of the
realme being present, and swearing fealtie vnto him, as to their true
and lawfull souereigne.</p>

<p>Howbeit, there were diuerse of the wiser sort of all estates, which
regarding their former oth, could haue b&eacute;ene contented that the empresse
should haue gouerned till hir sonne had come to lawfull age;
notwithstanding they held their peace as yet, and consented vnto
<span class="rightnote">Periurie punished.</span>
Stephan. But this breach of their othes was worthilie punished
afterward, insomuch that as well the bishops as the other Nobles either
died an euill death, or were afflicted with diuerse kinds of calamities
and mischances, and that euen here in this life, of which some of them
as occasion serueth shall be remembred hereafter. Yet there were of them
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> The bishop of Salisburies protestation.</span>
(and namelie the bishop of Salisburie) which protested that they were
fr&eacute;e from their oth of allegiance made to the said empresse, bicause
that without the consent of the lords of the land she was maried out of
the realme, whereas they tooke their oth to receiue hir for queene, vpon
that condition, that without their assent she should not marrie with any
person out of the realme.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The bishops think to please God in breaking their oth.</span>
Moreouer (as some writers thinke) the bishops tooke it, that they should
doo God good seruice in prouiding for the wealth of the realme, and the
aduancement of the church by their periurie. For whereas the late
deceassed king vsed himselfe not altogither for their purpose, they
thought that if they might set vp and creat a king ch&eacute;eflie by their
especiall meanes and authoritie, he would follow their counsell better,
and reforme such things as they iudged to be amisse. But a great cause
that mooued manie of the lords vnto the violating thus of their oth, was
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Hugh Bigot.</span>
(as some authors rehearse) for that Hugh Bigot, sometime steward to king
Henrie the first, immediatlie after the decease of king Henrie, came
into England, and as well before the archbishop of Canturburie, as
diuers other lords of the land, tooke a voluntarie oth (although most
men thinke that he was hired so to doo bicause of great promotion)
declaring vpon the same that he was present a little before king Henries
death, when the same king adopted and chose his nepheue Stephan to be
his heire and successour, bicause his daughter, the empresse had
gr&eacute;euouslie displeased him. But vnto this mans oth the archbishop and
the other lords were so hastie in giuing of credit. Now the said Hugh
for his periurie, by the iust iudgment of God, came shortlie after to a
miserable end.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
<span class="yearnote">1136.</span>
But to our purpose. King Stephan (by what title soeuer he obteined the
crowne) immediatlie after his coronation, went first to Reading to the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
buriall of the bodie of his vncle Henrie, the same being now brought
ouer from Normandie, from whence after the buriall he repaired to
Oxenford, and there calling a councell of the lords &amp; other estates of
his realme; amongst other things he promised before the whole assemblie
(to win the harts of the people) that he would put downe and quite
<span class="rightnote">The faire promises of king Stephan.</span>
abolish that tribute which oftentimes was accustomed to be gathered
after the rate of their acres of hides or land, commonlie called
Danegilt, which was two shillings of euerie hide of land. Also, that he
would so prouide, that no bishop sees nor other benefices should remaine
void, but immediatlie after vpon their first vacation, they should be
againe bestowed vpon some conuenient person meet to supplie the roome.
Further he promised not to seize vpon any mans woods as forfeit, though
any priuate man had hunted and killed his d&eacute;ere in the same woods, as
the maner of his predecessour was. &para;&nbsp;For a kind of forfeiture was
deuised by king Henrie, that those should lose their right inheritance
in their woods, that chanced to kill any of the kings d&eacute;ere within the
same.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" ></a><span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> Licence to build castels.</span>
Moreouer, he granted licence to all men, to build either castell, tower,
or other hold for defense of themselues vpon their owne grounds. Al this
did he chieflie in hope that the same might be a safegard for him in
time to come, if the empresse should inuade the land, as he doubted she
shortlie would. Moreouer he aduanced manie yoong &amp; lustie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> In nouella historia.</span>
gentlemen to great liuings. For such as were of any noble familie, and
thereto through a certeine stoutnesse of stomach sought preferment,
easilie obteined of him the possession of castels and great lordships,
diuerse of whom he honored with titles of dignitie, creating some of
them earles and some lords. Now, such was their importunate sute in
demanding, that when he had little more to bestow amongst them, hauing<a name="FNanchor_4_1" id="FNanchor_4_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
alreadie giuen sundrie portions that belonged to the crowne, they
ceassed not to be in hand with him for more, and being denied with
reasonable excuses on his behalfe, they thought themselues ill dealt
withall, and so turning from him, fortified their castels and holds,
making open warre against him: as hereafter shall appeare.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The resort of strangers to serue king Stephan.</span>
There came ouer vnto him also a great number of Flemings and Britons to
serue him as souldiers, whom he reteined, to be the stronger and better
able to defend himselfe against the malice of the empresse, by whom he
looked to be molested he wist not how soone. Wherefore he shewed
himselfe verie liberall, courteous, and gentle towards all maner of
persons at the first, and (to saie truth) more liberall, familiar, and
free harted than stood with the maiestie of a king: which was afterward
a cause that he grew into contempt. &para;&nbsp;But to such meanes are princes
driuen, that atteine to their estates more through fauour and support of
others, than by any good right or title which they may pretend of
themselues. Thus the gouernement of this prince at the beginning was
nothing bitter or heauie to his subiects, but full of gentlenesse,
lenitie, courtesie, and mildnes.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
Howbeit whilest these things were a dooing, certeine of the English
Nobilitie, abhorring both the king and the present state of his
gouernment, went priuilie out of the realme into Scotland to king Dauid,
declaring vnto him what a detestable act was committed by the lords of
England, in that (contrarie to their oth made vnto the empresse Maud,
and hir issue) they had now crowned Stephan. Wherefore they besought the
said king to take in hand to reuenge such a vile iniurie practised
against hir, and to restore the kingdome vnto the said empresse, which
if he did, it should be a thing most acceptable both to God and man.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The king of Scots inuadeth the English marshes.
<i>Sim.&nbsp;Dunel.</i> <i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
King Dauid hauing heard and well weied the effect of their request,
foorthwith was so mooued at their words, that in all possible hast he
assembled an armie, and entring into England, first tooke the citie and
castell of Carleil: afterward comming into Northumberland, he tooke
Newcastell and manie other places vpon the borders there. Whereof king
Stephan being aduertised, streightwaies assembled a power, and
foorthwith hasted into Cumberland, meaning to recouer that againe by
<span class="rightnote">K. Stephan encamped n&eacute;ere to his enimie the K. of Scots.</span>
force of armes, which the enimie had stolen from him by craft and
subtiltie. At his approch n&eacute;ere to Carleil, he pitched downe his field
in the euening, thinking there to staie till the morning, that he might
vnderstand of what power the enimie was, whome he knew to be at hand.</p>

<p>King Dauid also was of a fierce courage, and redie inough to haue giuen
him battell, but yet when he beheld the English standards in the field,
<span class="rightnote">An accord made betwixt the two kings Stephan and Dauid.</span>
and diligentlie viewed their order and behauiour, he was at the last
contented to giue care to such as intreated for peace on both sides.
Wherevpon comming to king Stephan, he entred a fr&eacute;endlie peace with him,
wherein he made a surrender of Newcastell, with condition that he should
reteine Cumberland by the fr&eacute;e grant of king Stephan, who hoped thereby
to find king Dauid the more faithfull vnto him in time of need: but yet
he was deceiued, as afterwards manifestlie app&eacute;ered. For when king
Stephan required of him an oth of allegiance, he answered that he was
once sworne alreadie vnto Maud the empresse. Howbeit
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" ></a><span class="pagenum">[81]</span>

gaue him the earledome of Huntington to hold of him for euer.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hec.&nbsp;Boetius.</i></span>
&para;&nbsp;The Scotish chronicles set out the matter in other order, but yet all
agr&eacute;e that Henrie sweare fealtie to king Stephan, as in the said
historie of Scotland you may s&eacute;e more at large. Now after that king
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i>
King Stephan sicke.</span>
Stephan had concluded a peace with king Dauid, he returned to London,
and there kept his Easter with great ioy and triumphes: who whilest he
was yet in the middest of all his pastime, about Rogation w&eacute;eke, he
chanced to fall sicke of a litargie, by reason whereof a rumor was spred
ouer all the realme that he was dead. Which though it was but a vaine
tale, and of no importance at the first, yet was it after the occasion
of much euill. For vpon that report great sedition was raised by the
<span class="rightnote">False rumors what hurt they oftentimes doo.</span>
kings enimies amongst the people, the minds of his fr&eacute;ends were
alienated from him, &amp; manie of the Normans (which were well practised in
periuries &amp; treasons) thought they might boldlie attempt all misch&eacute;efes
that came to hand, and hervpon some of them vndertooke to defend one
<span class="rightnote">Hugh&nbsp;Bigot. Baldwin&nbsp;Reduers. Robert&nbsp;Quisquere.</span>
place, and some another. Hugh Bigot erle of Norfolke a valiant chieftein
entered into Norwhich, Baldwin Reduers tooke Excester, &amp; Robert
Quisquere got certeine castels also into his hands.</p>

<p>King Stephan hearing what his enimies had doone, though he was somewhat
mooued with this alteration of things, yet as one nothing afraid of the
matter, he said merilie to those that stood about him: "We are aliue yet
God be thanked, and that shall be knowne to our enimies yer it be long."
Neither doubted he any thing but some secret practise of treason, and
therefore vsing all diligence, he made the more hast to go against his
enimies, whose attempts though streightwaies for the more part he
repressed, yet could he not recouer the places (without much adoo) that,
they had gotten, as Excester, and others: which when he had obteined, he
contented himselfe for a time and followed not the victorie any further
in pursuing of his enemies. Wherevpon they became more bold afterward
than before; in somuch that soone after they practised diuerse things
against him, whereof (God willing) some in places conuenient shall
appeare: howbeit they permitted him to remaine in quiet for a time. But
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
whilest he studied to take order in things at home (perceiuing how no
small number of his subiects did dailie shew themselues to beare him no
hartie good will) he began by little and little to take awaie those
liberties from the people, which in the beginning of his reigne he had
granted vnto them, and to denie those promises which he had made,
according to the saieng, "That which I haue giuen, I would I had not
giuen, and that which remaineth I will k&eacute;epe still." This sudden
alteration and new kind of rough dealing purchased him great enuie
amongst all men in the end. About the same time, great commotions were
<span class="rightnote">Geffrey earle of Aniou.</span>
raised in Normandie by meanes of the lord Geffrey earle of Aniou,
husband to Maud the empresse, setting the whole countrie in trouble: but
yer any newes thereof came into England, king Stephan went against
Baldwin Reduers, who being latelie (though not without great and long
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dunel.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
siege expelled out of Excester) got him into the Isle of Wight, and
there began to deuise a new conspiracie. Howbeit the king comming
suddenlie into the Isle, tooke it at the first assault, and exiled
Baldwin out of the realme.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;2. <br />
1137.</span>
Having thus with good successe finished this enterprise, and being now
<span class="rightnote">K. Stephan passeth into Normandie.</span>
aduertised of the businesse in Normandie, he sailed thither with a great
armie: and being come within two daies iournie of his enimie the earle
of Aniou, he sent foorth his whole power of horssemen, diuided into
three parts, which were not gone past a daies iournie forward, but they
encountred the earle, finding him with no great force about him.
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Aniou put to flight.</span>
Wherevpon giuing the charge vpon him, they put him to flight, and slue
manie of his people. Which enterprise in this maner valientlie atchiued,
euen according to the mind of king Stephan, he ioined in freendship with
<span class="rightnote">Lewes king of France. Eustace son to king Stephan.</span>
Lewes the seuenth king of France: and hauing latelie created his sonne
Eustace duke of Normandie, he presentlie appointed him to doo his homage
vnto the said Lewes for the same.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" ></a><span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
Now whereas his elder brother
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Theobald erle of Blois.</span>
Theobald earle of Blois at that time in Normandie, found himselfe
greeued, that Stephan the yoonger brother had vsurped the lands that
belonged to their vncle king Henrie, rather than himselfe, Stephan to
stop this iust complaint of his brother, and to allaie his mood, agr&eacute;ed
<span class="rightnote">K. Stephan agr&eacute;eth with the earle of Aniou.</span>
with him, couenanting to paie him yearelie two thousand marks of such
current monie as was then in vse. Furthermore, wheras Geffrey the earle
of Aniou demanded in right of his wife the empresse, the whole kingdome
of England, to be at an end with him, king Stephan was contented to
satisfie him with a yearelie pension of fiue thousand marks, which
composition he willinglie receiued.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
Thus when he had prouided for the suertie of Normandie, he returned
againe into England, where he was no sooner arriued, but aduertisement
was giuen him of a warre newlie begon with the Scots, whose king vnder a
colour of obseruing the oth to the empresse, made dailie insurrections
<span class="rightnote">The Scots inuade the English borders.</span>
and inuasions into England, to the great disturbance of king Stephan and
the annoiance of his people. Wherwith being somewhat mooued, he went
streightwaies toward the north parts, and determined first to besiege
Bedford by the waie, which apperteined to the earledome of Huntington,
by gift made vnto Henrie the sonne of king Dauid, and therevpon at that
present kept with a garison of Scotish men.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i>.</span>
This place did the king besiege by the space of 30. daies togither,
giuing thereto euerie daie an assault or alarme, in somuch that
c&#333;ming thither on Christmasse daie, he spared not on the morow to
assaile them, and so at length wan the towne from them by m&eacute;ere force
and strength. King Dauid hearing those newes, and being alreadie in

<span class="rightnote">King Dauid inuaded Northumberland.

<i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
armour in the field, entered into Northumberland, and licensed his men
of warre to spoile and rob the countrie thereabout at their pleasure.
Herevpon followed such crueltie, that their rage stretched vnto old and
yoong, vnto preest and clearke, yea women with child escaped not their
hands, they hanged, headed, and slue all that came in their waie: houses
were burnt, cattell driuen awaie, and all put to fire and sword that
serued to any vse for rel&eacute;efe, either of man or beast.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Here we see what a band of calamities doo accompanie and waite vpon
warre, wherein also we haue to consider what a traine of felicities doo
attend vpon peace, by an equall comparing of which twaine togither, we
may easilie perceiue in how heauenlie an estate those people be that
liue vnder the scepter of tranquillitie, and contrariwise what a hellish
course of life they lead that haue sworne their seruice to the sword. We
may consider also the inordinat outrages of princes, &amp; their frantike
fiersenes, who esteeme not the losse of their subiects liues, the
effusion of innocent bloud, the population of countries, the ruinating
of ample regions, &amp;c.: so their will may be satisfied, there desire

<span class="rightnote">K. Stephan maketh hast to rescue the north parts.<br />
The Scots retire.<br />
K. Stephan burnt the south parts of Scotland.</span>
But to our storie. King Stephan hearing of this pitifull spoile, hasted
forward with great iournies to the rescue of the countrie. The Scots put
in feare of sp&eacute;edie comming to encounter them, drew backe into Scotland:
but he pursued them, and entring into their countrie burned and
destroied the south parts of that realme in most miserable maner.
Whilest king Stephan was thus about to beat backe the forren enimies,
and reuenge himselfe on them, he was assailed by other at home, &amp; not
without the iust vengeance of almightie God, who meant to punish him for
his periurie committed in taking vpon him the crowne, contrarie to his
<span class="rightnote">Robert earle of Glocester.</span>
oth made vnto the empresse and hir
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" ></a><span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
children. For Robert erle of
Glocester, base brother vnto the empresse, and of hir priuie councell,
sought by all meanes how to bring king Stephan into hatred, both of the
Nobles and commons, that by their helpe he might be expelled the realme,
and the gouernment restored to the empresse and hir sonne.</p>

<p>Such earnest trauell was made by this earle of Glocester, that manie of
his freends which fauoured his cause, now that king Stephan was occupied
in the north parts, ioined with him in conspiracie against their
<span class="rightnote">Bristow taken.</span>
souereigne. First the said earle himselfe tooke Bristowe; and after this
diuerse other townes and castels there in that countrie were taken by
him and others, with full purpose to k&eacute;epe the same to the behoofe of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Sim.&nbsp;Dun.</i><br />
Talbot.<br />
<i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i><br />
Louell. Painell. Fitz-John. Fitz-Alain.</span>
the empresse and hir sonne. Amongst other William Talbot tooke vpon him
to defend Hereford in Wales: William Louell held the castell of Gary:
Paganell or Painell kept the castell of Ludlow: William de Moun the
castell of Dunestor: Robert de Nicholl, the castle of Warram: Eustace
Fitz-John, the castle of Walton; and William Fitz-Alain, the castle of
Shrewesburie.</p>

<p>When word hereof came to king Stephan, he was maruellouslie vexed: for
being determined to haue pursued the Scots euen to the vttermost limits
of their countrie, he was now driuen to change his mind, and thought it
good at the first to stop the proceedings of his enimies at home, least
in giuing them space to increase their force, they might in processe of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i>
The castle of Douer deliuered to the qu&eacute;ene.
<i>Polydor.</i></span>
time growe so strong, that it would be an hard matter to resist them at
the last. Herevpon therefore he returned southward, and comming vpon his
enimies, recouered out of their hands diuers of those places which they
held, as Hereford, and the castle of Shrewesburie. About the same time
one Walkeline y&eacute;elded the castle of Douer vnto the qu&eacute;ene, who had
besieged him within the same.</p>

<p>Now king Stephan knowing that the Scots were not like long to continue
<span class="rightnote">Thurstan archbishop of Yorke made lieutenant of the north
ports.</span>
in quiet, returned northwards againe; and comming to Thurstan the
archbishop of Yorke, he committed the k&eacute;eping of the countrie vnto his
charge, commanding him to be in a redinesse to defend the borders vpon
any sudden inuasion. Which thing the couragious archbishop willinglie
vndertooke. By this meanes king Stephan being eased of a great part of
his care, fell in hand to besiege the residue of those places which the
rebels kept: but they fearing to abide the danger of an assault, fled
away, some into one part, and some into another; whom the kings power of
horssemen still pursuing and ouertaking by the way, slue, and tooke no
small number of them prisoners in the chase. Thus was the victorie in
maner wholie atchiued, and all those places recouered, which the enimies
had fortified.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The Scots eftsoones inuade Northumberland.</span>
In like maner when king Dauid heard that the king was thus vexed with
ciuill warre at home, he entred England againe in most forceable wise:
and sending his horssemen abroad into the countrie, commanded them to
waste and spoile the same after their accustomed maner. But in the meane
time he purposed with himselfe to besiege Yorke: which citie if he might
haue woone, he determined to haue made it the frontier hold against king
Stephan, and the rest that tooke part with him. Herevpon calling in his
horssemen from straieng further abroad, he marched thitherwards, and
comming neere to the citie, pitched downe his tents.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Archbishop Thurstan raiseth a power to fight with the Scots.</span>
In this meane while the archbishop Thurstan, to whom the charge of
defending the countrie cheefelie in the kings absence apperteined,
called togither the Nobles and gentlemen of the shire and parties
adioining, whom with so pithie and effectuall words he exhorted to
resist the attempts of the Scots (whose cruell dooings could k&eacute;epe no
measure) that incontinentlie all the power of the northparts was raised,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Sim.&nbsp;Dunel.</i> Capteines of the armie.</span>
and (vnder the leading of William earle of Albermarle, Walter Espeke,
William Peuerell of Nottingham, and two of the Lacies, Walter and
Gilbert) offered euen with perill of life and limme to trie the matter
against the Scots in a pight field, and either to driue them out of the
countrie, or else to loose their liues in the quarel of their prince.</p>

<p>It chanced at this time, that archbishop Thurstan was sicke, and
<span class="rightnote">Rafe bish. of Durham supplieth the roome of the archbishop.</span>
therefore could not
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" ></a><span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
come into the field himselfe, but yet he sent Rafe
bishop of Durham to supplie his roome, who though he saw and perceiued
that euerie man was readie enough to encounter with their enimies; yet
he thought good to vse some exhortation vnto them the better to
encourage them, in maner as here ensueth.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Sim.&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
"Most noble Englishmen, and ye right valient Normans, of whose courage
the Frenchman is afraid, by you England is kept vnder, by you Apulia
dooth flourish, and vnto you Jerusalem and Antioch haue y&eacute;elded their
subjection. We haue at this present the rebellious nation of Scotland
(which of right ought to be subiect to the crowne of England) come into
the field against vs, thinking for euermore to rid themselues of their
submission, and to bring both vs and our countrie into their bondage and
thraldome. Now albeit I see in you courage sufficient, to beat them
backe from any further attempt; yet least when you shall come to the
triall, by any manner of chance, you should loose any p&eacute;ece thereof, I
lamenting the state of my countrie (whose gr&eacute;euances I wish you should
redresse) doo meane to vse a few words vnto you, not for that I would
exhort you to doo any man wrong, but rather to beat them backe which
offer to doo you iniurie. Consider therefore that you shall here fight
with that enimie, whom you haue oftentimes vanquished, and oftentimes
offending in periurie, haue oftentimes most worthilie punished: whome
also (to be br&eacute;efe) raging after the maner of cruell robbers, wickedlie
spoiling churches, and taking awaie our goods, you did latelie
constreine to lurke in desert places and corners out of sight. Against
this enimie (I say) therefore worthie of reuengement for his so manifold
outrages, shew yourselues valiant, and with manlie stomaches driue him
out of our confines. For as far as I can perceiue, the victorie is
yours, God surelie will aid you, who cannot longer abide the sinnes of
this people. Wherefore he that looseth his life in so iust a quarell
(according to the saieng of our sauiour) shall find it. Let not their
rash and presumptuous boldnesse make you afraid, sith so manie tokens of
your approoued valiancie cannot cause them to stand in doubt of you. You
are clad in armour, and so appointed with helmet, curase, greiues, and
target, that the enimie knoweth not were to strike and hurt you. Then
sith you shall haue to doo with naked men, and such as vse not to weare
any armour at all, but more m&eacute;et for brablers and ale-house quarrellers
than men of warre vsed to the field: what should you stand in doubt of?
Their huge number is not able to stand against your skilfull order and
practised knowledge in all warlike feats and martiall discipline. A rude
multitude is but a let, rather than a furtherance to atchiue the
victorie. A small number of your worthie elders haue oftentimes
vanquished great multitudes of enimies." As the bishop was thus speaking
to the English armie, and before he grew to an end of his exhortation,
the Scots approched with their battels, &amp; first certeine of their bands
of horssemen were sent afore, to take the higher ground: which when the
Englishmen perceiued, they staied not till the enimies should begin the
<span class="rightnote">The Englishmen set vpon the Scots.</span>
battell, but straightwaies caused their trumpets to sound, and so giue
the onset.</p>

<p>The Scots were as readie to encounter with them, so that the battell
began to be verie hot, and euen at the first out flew the arrows, and
then the footmen ioined, who fought most fiercelie on both sides.
<span class="rightnote">The Scots of Lodian disorder the Englishmen.
<i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i>
<i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
Herewith a wing of them of Lodian, which were in the Scotish vauntgard,
brake in vpon the vauntgard of the English: but yet closing togither
againe, they kept out the enimies, and casting about with a wing,
compassed the Scotish horssemen round about, and panching their horsses,
they slue a great number, and constreined the residue to retire. Which
thing when their felowes in the other wing saw, their hearts began to
faint, and by and by betooke them to their heeles.</p>

<p>The rumor of this flight being notified to the maine battell of the
<span class="rightnote">The Scots put to flight.</span>
Scotish men, where king Dauid himselfe was fighting with his enimies,
discomfited them also, in such wise, that they in like began to shrinke
backe: first by parts, and after by heapes togither.
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" ></a><span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
The king did what
he could to staie them: but the English pressed so vpon them, that there
was no recouerie. Wherefore he himselfe was glad in the end to beare his
men companie, in s&eacute;eking to saue himselfe by flight, and make such shift
as he could amongst the residue.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Henrie earle of Huntington his valiancie.</span>
His sonne Henrie the earle of Huntington more regarding his honour, than
the danger of life, neither mooued with the flight of his father, nor
the ouerthrow of the other, came in amongst his men, being readie to
turne their backes, and with bold countenance spake these or the like
words vnto them, as the shortnesse of the time would permit. "Whither go
you good fellowes? Here shall you find armour and force, neither shall
you, whilest life remaineth in your capteine (whom ye ought to follow)
depart without the victorie. Therefore choose whether yee had rather
trie the matter with the enimies by battell, or to be put to a shamefull
death at home after your returns thither." The Scots mooued with these
vehement words of their valiant capteine, recoiled vpon their enimies,
and began to make hauocke of them: but being no great number, and beset
with the English footmen before, and the horssemen behind, they were
shortlie brought to distresse, and for the more part either taken or
slaine.</p>

<i>Polydor.</i></span>
At length earle Henrie perceiuing how the matter went, and that there
was no hope left of recouerie, fled also with those that could escape,
bitterlie cursing the frowardnesse of fortune, and mishap of that daies
chance. The number of them that were killed at this battell was aboue
ten thousand. In which number there were not manie of the English: but
yet among other, Walter Lacie the brother of Gilbert Lacie, one of their
cheefe capteines is remembered to be one. This battell was fought in the
moneth of August, in the fourth of king Stephan, who hearing of this
victorie, greatlie reioised, and gaue infinite commendations to his
subiects (the Englishmen and the Normans) but principallie praised
archbishop Thurstan and the bishop of Durham for their faithfull and
diligent seruice shewed in this behalfe.</p>

<p>On the other side he himselfe vsing the like good successe amongst the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i>
Castels recouered by king Stephan.</span>
rebels at home, ouercame them, and chased them out of the land. For in
this meane time he had taken the castels of Hereford, Glocester,
Webbeley, Bristowe, Dudley, and Shrewesburie. Likewise Robert earle of
Glocester not being able to resist the king thus preuailing against his
aduersaries on ech hand, fled into France vnto his sister the empresse.
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
After this, about Aduent, the popes legat one Alberike bishop of Hostia,
held a synod at London, within Paules church, where by the kings
consent, Theobald abbat of Bechellouin was consecrated archbishop of
<span class="rightnote">Theobald archbishop of Canturburie.</span>

<p>

The king hauing now accomplished his purpose, taken the castell of
Leides, and brought the state of the realme to a meetlie good staie,
thought it expedient after the late ouerthrow giuen to the Scots, to
pursue the victorie, and vtterlie to subdue them with all expedition. He
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> K. Stephan inuadeth Scotland.</span>
brought his armie therefore into Scotland, first wasting and spoiling
the countrie, and afterward preparing to fight with such Scots as came
foorth to defend their goods and houses. K. Dauid perceiuing himselfe to
be too weake, made sute to the king for peace, which with much
difficultie he obteined at length, by deliuering his sonne Henrie vnto
<span class="rightnote">A peace concluded betw&eacute;ene the two kings of England and
Scotland.</span>
king Stephan in pledge for the sure performance of couenants concluded
vpon betwixt them. Herevpon king Stephan hauing thus ended his businesse
in Scotland, returned into England: and after directing his iornie
towards Wales, he came to Ludlow: which towne (being held by his
aduersaries) he wan yer long out of their hands.
<span class="rightnote">Ludlow wun.</span>
</p>

<p>After this he went to Oxenford, where whilest he remained, a great brute
was spred abroad, that the empresse was comming with hir brother, the
earle of Glocester: which caused him to put the lesse trust in his
people from thenceforth, in so much that he began to repent himselfe
(although too late) for that he, had granted licence to so
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" ></a><span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
manie of his
subiects to build castels within their owne grounds. For he had them all
<span class="rightnote">Roger bishop of Salisburie. Alexander B. of Lincolne.
<i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i></span>
in suspicion: and amongst other, he vehementlie suspected Roger bishop
of Salisburie (who had doone verie much for him) and Alexander bishop of
Lincolne nephue to the said bishop of Salisburie, or (as some thought)
more n&eacute;ere to him in kindred than his nephue, I meane, his sonne. For
<span class="rightnote">Castels built by the bishop of Salisburie.</span>
the said Roger had builded diuerse castels, as at Shierborne, at the
Uies, and at Malmesburie. The said Alexander likewise following his
vncles example, bestowed his monie that way verie fr&eacute;elie, hauing
builded one castell at Newarke, and another at Sl&eacute;eford.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> Newarke castel built by the bishop of
Lincolne.<br />
The B. of Elie banished.</span>
The king therefore hauing committed both these bishops to prison, and
furthermore sent Nigell or Neill the bishop of Elie into exile (which
Nigell was nephue also to the foresaid bishop of Salisburie) he
threatened to keepe them without either meate or drinke, if they would
not cause these castels to be deliuered into his hands, whereby he
obteined them, and moreouer found in the bishop of Salisburies cofers
40. thousand marks, which he tooke to his owne vse, by way of
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Salisburie dieth of thought. <i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> In

confiscation for his disloiall demeanor. This ingratitude of the king
wounded the bishops hart, insomuch that taking thought for the losse of

<p>The quarrell which was first picked at these bishops, rose by occasion
of a fraie betwixt the bishops men and the seruants of Alaine duke of
Britaine, about the taking vp of Innes at their comming to Oxenford. In
which fraie one of the dukes men was killed, his nephue almost slaine,
and the residue of his folkes sore beaten and chased. Herevpon were the
bishops first committed to ward, and afterward handled at the kings
pleasure, as partlie ye haue heard.</p>

<p>For this Roger bishop of Salisburie, was in the daies of William Rufus a
poore pr&eacute;est, seruing a cure in a village n&eacute;ere the citie of Caen in
Normandie. Now it chanced, that the lord Henrie the kings brother came
thither on a time, and called for a pr&eacute;est to say masse before him.
Whervpon this Roger comming to the altar, was by and by readie and
quicke at it, and therewithall had so speedilie made an end thereof,
that the men of warre then attendant on the said lord Henrie, affirmed
that this pr&eacute;est aboue all other, was a chapleine meet to say masse
before men of warre, bicause he had made an end when manie thought he
had but newlie begun. Herevpon the kings brother commanded the preest to
follow him, insomuch that when oportunitie serued, for his diligent
seruice, and readie dispatch of matters, when Henrie had atteined the
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Salisburie made lord chancelour.</span>
crowne, he was by him aduanced to great promotions: as first to be
Chancelour of England, &amp; after bishop of Salisburie, growing still into
such estimation, that he might doo more with the king than any other of
the councell.</p>

<p>But to returne to king Stephan, who after he had thus imprisoned the
aforesaid bishops, manned those castles which he tooke from them with
his owne soldiers, in like maner as he had doone all the rest which he
had taken from the rebels, that he might the better withstand the
empresse and hir sonne, whose comming he euer feared. He began also to
shew himselfe cruell towards all men, and namelie against those that had
chieflie furthered his title to the obteining of the crowne. &para;&nbsp;This (as
manie tooke it) came to passe by the prouidence of almightie God, that
those should suffer for their periuries, which contrarie to law and
right had consented to crowne him king.</p>

<p><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" ></a><span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
<span class="rightnote">K. Stephan doubts whom to trust.</span>
In d&eacute;ed he wist not well whom he might trust, for he stood in doubt of
all men, bicause he was aduertised by credible report, that the empresse
sought for aid on all sides, meaning verie shortlie to come into
England. For this cause also he thought good to procure the fr&eacute;endship
of Lewes king of France, which he brought to passe, by concluding
<span class="rightnote">He c&#333;tracteth affinitie with the French king.</span>

Alberike de U&eacute;er pleadeth the kings cause.</span>
In the meane time, namelie on the first daie of September, a councell
was holden at Winchester, wherein earle Alberike de Ueer pleaded with
great eloquence the kings case, in excuse of his fault for imprisoning
the bishops, which was sore laid to his charge by his owne brother the
bishop of Winchester, being also the popes legat: who (togither with the
archbishop of Canturburie and other bishops) had called this councell
for that purpose. Howbeit they got nothing of the king but faire words,
and promises of amendment in that which had b&eacute;ene doone otherwise than
equitie required which promises were vtterlie vnperformed, and so the
councell brake vp.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The empresse landed here in England.</span>
In the moneth of Iulie the empresse Maud landed here in England at
Portesmouth, &amp; went strait to Arundell, which towne (togither with the
countie of Sussex) hir mother in law Adelicia king Henries second wife,
wedded to William de Albenay, held in right of assignation for hir
dower. There came in with the empresse hir brother Robert and Hugh
Bigot, of whom ye haue heard before.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">What power she brought with hir.</span>
Some write that the empresse brought with hir a great armie, to the
intent that ioining with Ranulph earle of Chester (who tooke part with
Robert erle of Glocester, bicause the same Rob. had maried his daughter)
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
she might fight with king Stephan, and trie the battell with him. Other
declare that she came to England now at the first, but with a small
power (as seuen score horssemen or men of armes as we may call them) in
hope of Gods assurance (who seldome faileth those that fight in a
rightfull cause) and againe vpon trust of aid of freends, who for the
benefits receiued at hir fathers hands, would be readie to go against
king Stephan. Wherevpon hir brother earle Robert leauing his sister in
the castle of Arundell, rode with all sp&eacute;ed vnto Glocester thorough his
enimies countrie, not taking with him past 12. men of armes, and as
manie archers on horssebacke, that vpon his c&#333;ming thither he might
<span class="rightnote">Earle Robert commeth to Glocester.</span>
leuie an armie with so much speed as was possible. Now when he came to
Glocester, though the citie was kept with a garison of soldiours placed
there by king Stephan, yet the townesmen, after they heard that their
earle was approched to the gates, they droue out the garison, &amp; receiued
him into the towne, where he remained a time, partlie to assemble an
armie, and partlie to practise with other townes and castels
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Brian the earle of Glocesters sonne. Miles
earle of Hereford.</span>
thereabouts, to reuolt vnto his sister. Amongst all other, the earles
sonne Brian, and Miles of Glocester were right ioifull of the news of
the empresses arriuall, and gladlie prepared themselues to fight in
defense of hir cause.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> The empresse besieged in Arundell castel.</span>
In the meane time king Stephan, hauing knowledge of the landing of the
empresse, and other his enimies, came strait to Arundell, where he
besieged hir in the castle, and spent his labour certeine daies in vaine
about the winning of it. Howbeit at that present he did not preuaile,
for there were certeine with him, who in fauour of the empresse bare him
in hand, that it was not possible to win that fortresse, and therefore
aduised him to raise his siege, and suffer the empresse to be at
libertie to go to some other place, where he might with more ease and
<span class="rightnote">The king raiseth his siege.</span>
lesse damage get hir into his hands. The king not perceiuing the drift
of those secret practisers, followed their counsell. Wherevpon the
empresse being now at libertie, went from place to place to trie and
solicit hir fr&eacute;ends: and as a riuer increaseth in the passage, so the
further the ladie went, the more hir power increased. About the midst of
the next night after the siege was raised, she departed out of the
<span class="rightnote">The empresse goeth to Bristow.</span>
castle, and with great iournies sped hir towards Bristow; which was
alreadie reuolted to hir side.</p>

<p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" ></a><span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
These things being thus bruted abroad, the Peeres of the realme
resorted to hir, as they that well remembred how in time past by oth of
allegiance they were suerlie bound to hir and hir issue. The king
<span class="rightnote">K. Stephen besiegeth Wallingford.</span>
in the meantime besieged the castle of Wallingford, but after he
vnderstood that the empresse was gotten to Bristow, repenting himselfe
for his light credit giuen to euill counsell, he left off the siege of
Wallingford, and drew towards Bristow, that he might (if it were
possible) inclose his aduersaries within that walled citie. But the
empresse, being aduertised of his determination (by such of hir fr&eacute;ends
as were resident about him) first went to Glocester, and after to
Lincolne, where she prouided vittailes and all other things necessarie
for hir armie and defense: purposing to remaine in that citie, till the
matter were either tried by chance of warre betwixt hir and king
Stephen, or that by the peoples helpe reuolting to hir side, he
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;6. <br />
1141.</span>
might be driuen out of the realme, and she restored to the whole
gouernement. The king followed hir verie earnestlie, and comming vnto
Lincolne besieged it, assaieng on euerie side which waie he might best
<span class="rightnote">K. Stephen winneth Lincolne, <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i>
<i>Polydor.</i> <i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
find meanes to win it, &amp; enter into the same. At length the empresse
found shift to escape from thence, and within a little while the king
got possession of the citie. But shortlie after, Robert earle of
Glocester, and Ranulph earle of Chester, Hugh Bigot, and Robert of
Morley assembling their power, aswell of Welshmen as others, to come to
the succour of those that were thus besieged, came to Lincolne, &amp;
pitching downe their tents n&eacute;ere to the enimies, they rested the first
night without making any great attempt.</p>

<span class="rightnote">The ordering of the kings armie readie to giue battell.
<i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
In the morning being the second daie of Februarie, so soone as it was
daie, they set their men in order of battell, and brought them foorth in
sight of the king and his host: who were on the other side, not meaning
to refuse the conflict, ordered his men readie to encounter them, whome
he diuided into 3. seuerall battels. The chiefest part of his armed men
he appointed to remaine on foot, amongst whom he placed himselfe, with
certeine noble men, as earle Baldwin, and others. The residue being
horssemen, he disposed into two seuerall wings, in one of which were
<span class="rightnote">The earles of Norfolke, Hampton, Mellent, &amp; Waren.</span>
Alaine duke of Britaine, Hugh Bigot earle of Norfolke, Simon earle of
Hampton, and two other carles, Mellent and Waren: Howbeit they were not
furnished with such number of men as had b&eacute;ene requisit; for as it fell
out, they brought no great retinues with them.
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Albermarle, William de Ypres.</span>
The other wing was
gouerned by the earle of Albemarle, and William de Ypres.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The ordering of the battels on the kings aduersaries part.</span>
Now on the aduersaries side, the earle of Chester led the fore ward, and
those whome king Stephan had disherited, were placed in the middle ward.
In the rere ward the earle of Glocester with his companie had the rule.
And besides those thr&eacute;e battels, the Welshmen were set as a wing at one
of the sides.</p>

<p>Here the earle of Chester (to vtter the good will which he had to fight)
appointed in faire armour as he was, spake these words in effect as
<span class="rightnote">The oration of the earle of Chester.
<i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i></span>
followeth, directing the same to the earle of Glocester, and other the
capteines, saieng: "I giue you hartie thanks, most inuincible
chiefteine, and you my fellow soldiers, which declare your hartie good
wils towards me, euen to the ieoparding of your liues at this my request
and instance. Sith then I am the occasion of your perill, it is
conuenient that I make the first entrance, and giue the onset of the
battell vpon that most disloiall king, who granting a truce, hath broken
the peace; and swearing to be a subiect, is now prooued a most wicked
vsurper: I therefore trusting both vpon reuenge of the vniust dealings
of this king, and also vpon mine owne force and courage, shall
straitwaies breake in sunder the arraie of his armie, and make waie
through the middest of the enimies with sword in hand. It shall be your
parts then to follow me, who will lead you the waie: for euen now my
mind giueth me, that I shall passe thorough the battels, tread the
capteines vnder foot, and run the king through with this my sharpe
sword."</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Glocesters answer to the earle of Chesters
oration.</span>
When he had thus ended, the earle of Glocester answered in this wise:
"It is not against reason that you should require the honor of the first
onset, both for the nobilitie of your house, and also in respect of the
prowesse wherein you excell: but yet if you
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" ></a><span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
stand vpon nobilitie, for
my part, being the sonne and nephue of a king, ought not I to be
preferred? If vpon valiance, here are manie verie worthie men, afore
whom there is not one aliue that may chalenge any prerogatiue. But
another reason moueth me most chieflie to be the formost. The king, who
contrarie to his oth made to my sister, hath cruellie vsurped the
kingdoms, and setting all in trouble, hath beene the cause of manie
thousand mens deaths, and distributed lands and liuings to such as haue
no right to the same, which he hath violentlie taken from the rightfull
owners, who are quite disherited. This king (I saie) is first to be
assailed with the assistance of the righteous iudge, who prepareth
punishment for wicked dooers. For almightie God, who iudgeth his people
with equitie, will looke downe from his heauenlie habitation, and will
not leaue vs comfortlesse in this so great a necessitie. One thing there
is, most valiant capteines, and all you right hardie souldiers, which I
would haue you to consider, that through the fennes, which much adoo you
<span class="rightnote">The necessitie to fight valientlie.</span>
haue passed, there is no waie to escape by flight. Here must we either
vanquish the enimies, or else die in the field: for no hope of safegard
remaineth in fl&eacute;eing awaie. This onelie resteth (I saie) that you make
waie for you to enter the citie with force of your weapons. If I be not
deceiued in that which my mind giueth me to coniecture, the lacke of
meanes to escape, otherwise than by shewing your selues valiant men, by
Gods helpe will bring vs the victorie. For he must n&eacute;eds plaie the man,
who hath not other succor to auoid the danger of destruction The
citizens of Lincolne, who shall fight so n&eacute;ere their houses as you shall
s&eacute;e, will not staie long to get them thither for their refuge. And
herewith consider and weie (I beseech you) against whom you shall match
<span class="rightnote">Alaine duke of Brittanie.</span>
in this battell. There is Alane duke of Britaine, who commeth armed
against you, yea rather against God, a wicked person, and spotted with
all kind of filthinesse; who in malice hath no p&eacute;ere, as one that neuer
wanted desire to doo misch&eacute;efe and who to be comparable in crueltie,
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Mellent.</span>
would iudge it a great reproch. There commeth also the earle of Mellent,
a man full of all guile and deceit, in whose hart iniquitie is rooted,
and nothing sounding in his mouth but vnthankfulnesse; besides this, he
is slothfull in d&eacute;eds, presumptuous in words, not hastie to fight, but
<span class="rightnote">Earle Hugh.</span>
swift to run awaie. Then commeth earle Hugh, who hath not thought it
sufficient to breake his oth to my sister the empresse, but he must
commit periurie the second time, in aduouching (vpon a new oth) that
king Henrie granted the kingdome to Stephan, and disabled his daughter.
After him marcheth the earle of Albemarle, a man of singular constancie
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Albermerles wife.</span>
in euill, verie readie to attempt and loth to giue ouer a mischeefe:
whose wife, through irkesomnes of his filthie behauiour is gone from
him; &amp; he that keepeth hir, c&#333;meth with him also against vs, an open
adulterer, &amp; one well esteemed of Bacchus, but nothing acquainted
<span class="rightnote">Simon earle of Hampton.</span>
with Mars. Then setteth foorth Simon earle of Hampton, whose d&eacute;eds
consist in words, &amp; whose gifts rest in promises. For when he hath said,
he hath doone; &amp; when he hath promised, ye get no more. Finallie there
come togither a knot of P&eacute;eres &amp; Noble men, [Like maister, like
seruants.] like to their king and maister, accustomed to robberies,
enriched with rapines, embrued with manslaughters, &amp; defamed with
periurie. You therefore (most valiant capteins &amp; hardie souldiers) whom
king Henrie hath aduanced, and this man hath brought vnder foot; whom he
made wealthie, and this man hath impouerished; vpon trust of your worthy
valiancie, yea rather vpon trust of Gods iustice seeke your reuenge thus
offered by God vpon these wicked wretches, &amp; with manlie stomachs vow to
go forward, &amp; forswere stepping back." When the earle had made an end,
all the armie (lifting vp their hands to Gods) abiured all intention to
fl&eacute;e, and so made themselues readie to set forward.</p>

<p>King Stephan hauing no pleasant voice of himselfe, appointed earle
Baldwin to giue an exhortation to his armie, wherevpon getting himselfe
<span class="rightnote">Earle Baldwin his oration on the behalfe of king Stephan.</span>
to an high place where he might be seene &amp; heard of them, he thus began.
"All such as shall giue battell, ought to fores&eacute;e thr&eacute;e things: first,
that their cause be righteous: secondlie, the number of their men to be
equall at the least: and thirdlie, the goodnesse and sufficiencie of them. The
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" ></a><span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Thr&eacute;e things to be fores&eacute;ene by them that shall giue
battell.</span>
righteousnes of their cause ought to be regarded, least men
runne in danger of the soule; the number of men is to be respected,
least they should be oppressed with multitude of enimies; and the
goodnesse of the soldiers is to be considered, least trusting in the
multitude, they should presume vpon the aid of feeble persons, &amp; such as
are of small valure. In all these points we see our selues sufficientlie
furnished. The iustice of our cause is this: that obseruing the thing
which we vowed to our king before God, we stand to the same against
those that haue falsified their faith, euen to the perill of death. Our
number is not much lesse in horssemen, and in footmen we exc&eacute;ed them. As
for the goodnesse or sufficiencie of our men, who is able to expresse
the noble prowesse of so manie earles, of so manie lords and soldiers,
trained vp euer in warres: The passing valiancie of our king may stand
in place of innumerable souldiers. Sith then he being the lords
annointed, is here amongst you, vnto whom ye haue vowed allegiance,
performe your vow. For the more earnestly and faithfully ye serue your
prince in this battell, which you are readie to fight against periured
persons, the more shall your reward be at the hands of God and him.
Therfore be of good comfort, &amp; haue in remembrance against whom
<span class="rightnote">Erle Robert.</span>
you doo darraine the battell. The force of erle Robert is well knowne,
his maner is to threaten much, &amp; to worke little, furious in words,
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Chester.</span>
eloquent of speach, but cold or rather dead harted in d&eacute;eds. The earle
of Chester what is he? A man of vnreasonable boldnesse, bent to
conspiracie, inconstant to performe that which he rashlie taketh in
hand, readie to run into batell, vncircumspect in danger, practising
things of great importance, s&eacute;eking after things vnpossible, bringing
with him few good soldiers, but gathering a vagrant rout of rascals.
There is nothing in him that we ought to be afraid of, for looke
whatsoeuer he attempteth manfullie, the same he giueth ouer womanlie, in
all his dooings vnfortunate, in all encounters either he is ouercome and
fl&eacute;eth awaie, or if he get the vpper hand (which seldome times chanceth)
he susteineth greater losse than they whom he dooth vanquish.</p>

<p>"The Welshmen, whom he bringeth with him are little est&eacute;emed of vs, who
pretend a naked rashnesse without any vse of armor, so that as men
without any knowledge of martiall policie, they fall as brute beasts
vpon the hunters iaueline. The other, as well the nobles as the common
souldiers are but runnagates and vagabounds; of whom I would wish the
number greater than it is: for the more they be, the woorse in effect
their seruice shall prooue in time of need. You therefore (most worthie
cheefetaines) you men of honor, it standeth you vpon to haue in regard
your vertue and dignities. This day aduance your renowme, and follow the
foresteps of your famous ancestors, leaue to your sonnes an euerlasting
<span class="rightnote">Continuall good successe a prouocation of boldnesse.</span>
commendation. The continuall successe of victorie ought to be a
prouocation vnto you to doo manfullie: the continuance of euil speed may
be to yonder side an occasion to run away. For euen alreadie (I dare
say) they repent them of their comming hither, and could be contented to
be gone, if the nature of the place would suffer them to depart. Then
sith it is not possible for them either to fight or to fl&eacute;e, what other
thing can they doo, but (as appointed by Gods ordinance) offer
themselues and all they haue about them presentlie vnto vs. Y&eacute;e s&eacute;e then
their horsses, their armour, and their bodies readie here at your
pleasure, lift vp your hearts therefore, and reach your hands to take
that with great chearefulnesse of mind, which the Lord hath thus offered
and freelie presented vnto you."</p>

<p>Now yer he had all made an end of his words, the batels were readie to
ioine, they met with great noise of trumpets and other instruments, and
the fight began with a verie sore and cruell slaughter. Hard it was in
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i></span>
the beginning to gesse who should haue the better. The wing of the
disherited men ouerthrew and bare downe their aduersaries, which were
led by the duke of Britain, and the forenamed earles. On the contrarie
part, the earle of Albemarle and William de Ypres put the Welshmen to
flight, but by the earle of Chester and his retinue, the same earle and
William de Ypres were fiercelie assailed afresh, and put out of order.
Thus was the kings side put to the worse, namelie
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" ></a><span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paru.</i> <i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i></span>
his horssemen, who
being placed in the forefront, and there ouermatched, fell to galoping.
Which thing when the king beheld, he was not yet any whit therewith
abashed, but like an hardie captein (as he was no lesse ind&eacute;ed)
comforted his footmen whom he had about him, and rushing vpon his
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
enimies, bare them down, and ouerthrew so manie as stood before him, so
that with the point of his weapon he made himselfe waie. His footmen,
who were but a few in number to the multitude of his enimies,
counteruailed in all points the prowes and manlike dooings of their king
and capteine, insomuch that few battels had beene better fought, nor
with greater slaughter on both sides, if the kings fore ward (which in
maner at the first shranke backe and was disordered, not without some
supicion of treason) had staied the brunt of the enimies a while, as it
had b&eacute;ene requisite. At length the king encountring with the earle of
Chester, being ouercharged with multitude, was taken prisoner by one
William de Cahames.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i></span>
Earle Baldwine, who had made the oration in the kings behalfe, was also
taken, after he had fought valiantlie and receiued manie sore wounds:
likewise Richard Fitzvrse, who on that daie had shewed good proofe of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
his manhood, and had giuen and received manie a sore stripe. To
conclude, all those that abode with the king, and namelie all
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paru.</i></span>
the footmen were taken prisoners, those which were slaine in the place
excepted. This battell was fought in the sixt yeare of king Stephans
reigne, vpon Candlemas daie, being sundaie, as Niger saith.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> The king led to Bristow.</span>
The king being apprehended and brought to the empresse lieng at
Glocester, was commanded by hir to be conueied in safetie vnto Bristow,
where he was kept as prisoner from that time of his taking, vntill the
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paru.</i></span>
feast of All saints next ensuing. Not long after this field fought, as
ye haue heard, Geffrey earle of Aniou husband to the empresse, receiuing
aduertisement of this victorie atchiued in England, foorthwith inuaded
Normandie, inducing all the Nobles of the countrie to incline vnto him:
for by publishing the captiuitie of king Stephan, it was easie for him
to come by the possession of the same.</p>

she (like a woman of great wisedome, as she was no lesse ind&eacute;ed) iudging
that it stood hir vpon to vse the victorie which fell to hir lot, slept
not hir businesse, but went forward, and setting from Glocester, she
came to Winchester, where she was honorablie receiued of bishop Henrie,
though he was king Stephans brother, and inwardlie lamented the
misfortune of the king. Then came she backe againe to Wilton, and so to
Oxenford, from thence to Reading, and then to S. Albons, into all which
cities and townes she was receiued with great triumph and honour.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Sh&eacute;e c&#333;meth to London.</span>
Hauing thus passed through all the south parts of the realme on that
side, she finallie came to London, where the citizens welcomed hir in
most ioifull and hartie maner. Now being come to London, and consulting
with those of hir councell for the quieting of the whole state of the
<span class="rightnote">The qu&eacute;ene sueth to the empresse for the deliuerie of hir
husband.</span>
realme, queene Maud wife to king Stephan (for so she was also called)
made humble suit vnto hir to haue hir husband set at libertie, promising
that he should resigne his whole claime and title into hir hands, and
content himselfe with a priuate life. But hir suit was so farre off from
being granted, that she was reiected and cast off with reprochfull
words. Wherevpon she conceiued a most high displeasure, and vnderstood
well inough; that peace was to be purchased by force of armes onelie,
and not by any other meanes: insomuch that with all diligence she sent
to hir sonne Eustace (then being in Kent) &amp; willed him to prepare an
armie, which he did most sp&eacute;edilie.</p>

<p>It chanced at the same time that the citizens of London made great and
laborious suit vnto the said empresse, that they might haue the lawes of
king Edward the Confessour restored, and the straight lawes of hir
father king Henrie abolished. But for so much as they could get no grant
<span class="rightnote">The Londoners conspire to take the empresse.</span>
of their petition, and perceiued the empresse to be displeased with them
about that importunat request, wherein onelie she ouershot hir selfe,
they
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" ></a><span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
deuised how and by what meanes they might take hir prisoner,
knowing that all the Kentishmen would helpe to strengthen<a name="FNanchor_4_3" id="FNanchor_4_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> them in their
enterprise. But reckoning with hir selfe that
<br />
<span style="margin-left:3em;">Nil poterit propera tutius esse fuga,<br /></span>

<span class="rightnote">Sh&eacute;e fled in the night time out of the citie.</span>
And being warned thereof, she fled by night out of the citie, and went
to Oxenford, determining to be reuenged vpon hir aduersaries when time
should serue hir turne. Herewith she began to wax more displeased both
against those Nobles whom she kept in prison, &amp; other also whom she
troubled, but namelie king Stephan, whom she commanded to be loden with
yrons, and serued with verie slender diet.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
Now when she had thus fled out of London, which was about the feast of
the natiuitie of S. John Baptist, the tower of London was besieged,
<span class="rightnote">Geffrey de Mandeuile.</span>
which Geffrey de Mandeuile held, and valiantlie defended. The same
Geffrey rushing out on a time, came to Fulham, where he tooke the bishop
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Lond&#333; taken.</span>
of London then lodging in his manor place, being one of the contrarie
faction.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
Henrie bishop of Winchester perceiuing the wrath of the empresse more
and more to increase dailie against hir people, thinking it wisedome to
serue the time, manned all the castels which he had builded within his
<span class="rightnote">Castells fortified by the bishop of Winchester.</span>
dioces; as at Waltham, Farnham, and other places and withdrew himselfe
into the castell of Winchester, there to remaine, till he might s&eacute;e to
what end the furie of the woman would grow. This being knowne, the
empresse tooke vnto hir Dauid king of Scotland that was hir vncle, who
immediatlie ioining their armies togither, went to Winchester and
besieged the castell. In the meane time the qu&eacute;ene and hir sonne
Eustace, with the helpe of their freends, as the Kentishmen, the
Londoners and other had assembled a great armie, and appointed the
<span class="rightnote">William de Ypresse. <i>Ia.&nbsp;Meir.</i></span>

father also was sonne to Robert earle of Flanders, surnamed Frisius.
This William was banished out of his countrie by Theodorike Elsas earle
of Flanders, bicause he attempted to bereaue him of his earledome.</p>

<p>The qu&eacute;enes armie thus committed to his guiding, came n&eacute;ere vnto

length perceiuing the aduantage after the comming of a great supplie of
Londoners to their aid, they set vpon hir armie as the same was
departing, with such violence, that straightwaies hir host was put to
flight and discomfited. The empresse was glad to faine hir selfe dead,
and so to be conueied in a coch as a dead corps vnto Glocester. Hir
brother Robert with manie other of the Nobles that staied behind, till
she and other might get out of danger, were taken prisoners. And bicause
the king was kept at Bristow vnder the custodie of the said Robert, the
queene caused him to be hardlie handled, that he might prooue the words
of the gospell true: "With what measure y&eacute;e meat vnto other, with the
same by other shall it be remeasured vnto you." He had deserued verie
euill of the king heretofore, and therefore it was now remembred. He was
taken (in maner abouesaid) on the feast day of the exaltation of the
crosse.</p>

<i>Polydor.</i></span>
Dauid king of Scotland was not at the battell himselfe, but hearing of
the discomfiture, got him out of the countrie, and by helpe of trustie
guides returned into Scotland, whilest Alberike de U&eacute;er was slaine at
London in a seditious tumult raised by the citizens. The kingdome being
thus diuided into two seueral factions, was by all similitudes like to
come to vtter ruine: for the people kindled in hatred one against
another, sought nothing else but reuenge on both sides, and still the
land was spoiled and wasted by the men of warre which lodged within the
castels and fortresses, and would often issue out to harrie and spoile
the countries. But now that the two cheefest heads were prisoners, there
was good hope conceiued that God had so wrought it, whereby might grow
some ouerture of talke, to quiet such troubles by fr&eacute;endlie peace and
agreement.</p>

<p>Herevpon those lords that wished well to the common-wealth, began to
intreate betwixt <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" ></a><span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
them, and articles were propounded for a concord to be
had, and an exchange of prisoners on both sides. But the empresse and
hir brother would not hearken to any agr&eacute;ement, except that the realme
<span class="rightnote"><i>Geruasius&nbsp;Dorober.</i> The king and the earle of Glocester
deliuered by exchange.</span>
might wholie remaine to the said empresse. Whereby the enimies were
rather increased than decreased by his treatie, so that at length the
king and the earle (weried with tedious yrksomnesse of yrons and hard
imprisonment, and putting all their hope in the chance of war) about the
feast of All saints made by deliuering of the one for the other, without
making mention of any peace at all: and so kindled with new
displeasures, they renewed the warre.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;7. <br />
1142.</span>
King Stephan being deliuered in such wise as you haue heard, comming to
London, and there being accompanied with his brother Henrie bishop of
Winchester (then the popes legat) Theobald archbishop of Canturburie,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Geruasius&nbsp;Dorobernensis.</i> A parlement called.</span>
and others, he called a parlement, wherein the king declared the present
state, how the enimie was brought to this point, that if it would please
the Nobles of the realme to mainteine him with men &amp; monie, he trusted
now so to worke, as they should not need to feare submission to the yoke
of a womans gouernment: which at the first they seemed much to mislike,
and now sithens (to their great gr&eacute;efe) had prooued to be intollerable.
The summe of his talke tended to this end, that those which were able of
themselues to aid him with their owne persons, should prepare them out
of hand so to doo; and the residue that were not meet (as bishops, and
such like maner of men) should be contributors to aid him with hired
souldiers, armour, and monie.</p>

<p>This was gladlie agr&eacute;ed vpon, with the generall consent of all the
assemblie. And bicause the bishops shewed themselues verie liberall
towards the aduancing of the kings purpose, there was a statute made at
the same parlement, that who so euer did laie any violent hands on a
<span class="rightnote">A statute established in fauour of pr&eacute;ests.</span>
sacred person, or else tooke vpon him to apprehend any of them, for what
fault soeuer, without the bishops licence, he should be accursed, and
not be assoiled of any maner of person, except of the pope, as by a
canon it was alreadie decr&eacute;ed but not obeied among the Englishmen till
that daie. &para;&nbsp;The cause of making this statute was ch&eacute;eflie, for that
preests during the time of the ciuill wars, were dailie either slaine,
or taken prisoners, and so put to their ransoms, or charged with great
penalties and gr&eacute;euous fines.</p>

<p>The bishop of Winchester at this councell also began an other brall
among the cleargie, for being brother to king Stephan, &amp; armed with the
popes authoritie as his legat in England, by reason of exercising his
authoritie, fell at variance with the bishop of Canturburie, who tooke
himselfe for his superior, bicause he was his primat. This quarell grew
so far in question, that they went both to Rome to haue the controuersie
decided, and so bringing their sutes thither, contented well the eares
of them that had the hearing of the same: for the more weightie the
cause seemed, the better it liked them.</p>

vnmeet men into episcopall s&eacute;es, for that they were not so qualified as

inordinate affections from the beginning of this our chronicle in the
best (I meane in respect of their estates) of this liuerie, and may
iustlie impute it to the defection of Gods spirit in them, whose nature
is to plant peace and m&eacute;ekenesse in the harts of his tenants, not
discord, not ambition, not the works of darknesse, which bes&eacute;eme not the

<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Earle Robert passeth ouer into Normandie.</span>
As the king began (after his libertie obteined) to prouide for warres,
so earle Robert (after he was discharged) sailed ouer into Normandie,
taking with him the sonnes of diuerse Noble men who fauored the
empresse, whome he deliuered to hir husband the earle of Aniou to be
kept as pledges, &amp; earnestlie besought him to passe ouer into England
with an armie to aid the empresse. Howbeit bicause he was newlie intred
<span class="rightnote">Normandie woone by the earle of Aniou.</span>
into the conquest of Normandie, and had alreadie won the most part
thereof, he thought good to make first an end of his warres there,
hauing somewhat to doo against certeine rebels of his owne countie of
Aniou, which did not a little molest him. But he recouered (whilest the
earle of Glocester was there with him) Alney, Mortaigne, Tenerchbray,
and diuerse other places perteining chieflie to the earle of Mortaigne:
about the same time also they of Constances submitted themselues vnto
him. Thus the earle of Aniou being occupied in those parties, could not
well come into England.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> Earle of Glocester returneth.<br /><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i>
</span>
Wherevpon the earle of Glocester came backe againe himselfe, and
bringing with him somewhat lesse than foure hundred men of armes
(imbarked in 52. ships) landed with the same at Warrham, and besieged
the castell there, which his enimies had won out of his hands whilest he
was absent in Normandie. In the end they that were within it (vnder the
gouernment of Herebert de Lucy) fell to agreement by composition, that
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i></span>
if they were not succoured by a certeine time, they should deliuer the
castell vnto the earle. King Stephan himselfe the same time held a siege
before Oxford, within the which he had inclosed the empresse, as
hereafter shall be shewed: so that they within the castell of Warrham
had no succour sent vnto them, and therefore (according to the articles
of their composition) they yeelded vp the hold, after erle Robert had
lien three w&eacute;ekes before it.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The ile of Portland. Circester.</span>
This castell being thus woone, earle Robert subdued also such as kept
the ile of Portland, and had fensed it after the maner of a fortresse:
afterwards he came to Circester, and there assembled all those that
fauoured the part of the empresse, meaning with all conuenient sp&eacute;ed to
go to Oxford, &amp; there to giue battell to king Stephan, if he would abide
it. Who after his deliuerance from captiuitie, had assembled a great
<span class="rightnote">The empresse besieged in Oxford.</span>
host of men, and comming to Oxford, where the empresse then laie,
suddenlie besieged hir, before she looked for him. And to the end also
that he might compell the townsmen to yeeld, or else k&eacute;epe them from
entring which would come to their succors, he ranged abroad into the
countrie with part of his armie, wasting all afore him by fire &amp; sword.
This siege continued almost two moneths, in maner from his deliuerie in
the beginning of Nouember, vntill Christmasse immediatlie following: in
somuch that through lacke of vittels they within the towne began to
raise mutinies. The empresse therefore doubting the sequele, and s&eacute;eing
hir prouision to decaie, deuised a shift how to escape that present
danger, which by force she was vnlikelie to performe.</p>

It was a verie hard winter that yeare, the Thames and other riuers
thereabouts were frosen, so that both man and horsse might safelie passe
oner vpon the yce, the fields were also couered with a thicke and d&eacute;epe
snow. Herevpon taking occasion, she clad hir selfe and all hir companie
in white apparell, that a far off they might not be discerned from the
snow; and so by negligence of the watch that kept ward but slenderlie,
by reason of the exc&eacute;eding cold weather, she and hir partakers secretlie
in the night issued out of the towne, and passing ouer the Thames, came
to Walingford, where she was receiued into the castell by those that had
the same in k&eacute;eping to hir vse: of whom Brian the sonne to the erle of
Glocester was the chiefe.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Here we may see the subtiltie of the empresse, whereby she obteined
fr&eacute;e and safe passage out of hir enimies hands, who otherwise had taken
hir in their net. So that it will be true, that hath neuer b&eacute;ene false,

a good intent, but most commonlie directed to an euil meaning and
purpose, as the euents themselues doo manie times declare. But let vs
s&eacute;e what followed vpon this escape of the empresse.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
After hir departure from Oxford, the townesmen yeelded vnto the king,
who hauing taken order for the k&eacute;eping of them in obedience, marched
toward Walingford, minding to besiege the castell there: but being
encountred in the way by his enimies, he was driuen backe, and so
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;8. <br />
1143</span>
constreined to turne another waie. Earle Robert hearing that his sister
was escaped and gotten to Wallingford, hasted thither with all sp&eacute;ed to
<span class="rightnote">The empress hir sonne lord Henrie.</span>
visit hir: &amp; (as some write) brought with him hir sonne the lord Henrie
that was come with him from beyond the seas, to s&eacute;e his mother: so that
the empresse now beholding both hir sonne and brother, receiued them
with all the ioy and honour that she could or might presentlie make
them. Hir son remaining vnder the gouernement of earle Robert, was then
appointed by him to abide within the citie of Bristow, &amp; there continued
for the space of 4. y&eacute;eres, being committed to one Matthew his
schoolemaister, to be instructed in knowledge, and trained vp in ciuill
behauiour.</p>

<p>King Stephan (after the spoiling of sundrie churches, the robbing and
burning of manie townes and villages by the hands of his hired
souldiers, who for the more part were Flemings) came at length with his
<span class="rightnote">The king commeth to Wilton.</span>
brother the bishop of Winchester stronglie armed vnto Wilton, where he
tooke in hand to fortifie the nunrie in steed of a castell, to resist
the incursions and inrodes of them of Salisburie, who in the behalfe of
the empresse had doone manie displeasures vnto his fr&eacute;ends: but earle
Robert vnderstanding of his dooings, got a power togither with all
speed, and the first daie of Julie about sunne setting came to Wilton,
and suddenlie set the towne on fire.</p>

<p>The king being lodged within the nunrie, and fearing no such matter,
after he heard of the sudden assemblie of his enimies, was put in such
feare, that he tooke himselfe dishonourablie to flight, leaning his men,
his plate, and other riches altogither behind him. The earles souldiers
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Par.</i> <i>Sim.&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>M.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
egerlie assailed the kings people, killed and spoiled them at their
pleasure, rifled the kings treasurie without resistance, and satisfied
themselues with greedines. In this broile was William Marcell or Martell
taken prisoner by earle Roberts men, &amp; led to the castell of
Wallingford, where Brian the earle of Glocesters sonne hauing charge of
that castell, kept him in close prison, and vsed him hardlie, who by
reason of the opinion which men had conceiued of his valiancie, could
not be deliuered, till he had paid 300. marks for his ransome, and
deliuered the castell of Shirborne into the earles hands. Within a few
<span class="rightnote">Miles earle of Hereford deceased.</span>
daies after, Miles earle of Hereford departed this life, whose death was
verie gr&eacute;euouslie taken of the empresse, for he was one of hir ch&eacute;efe
fr&eacute;ends and councellers. His eldest sonne Roger succ&eacute;eded him, a
gentleman though yoong in yeares, yet valiant and forward in feats of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> The earle of Essex taken.</span>
armes. William Mandeuile earle of Essex, an ancient capteine, &amp; an
expert warriour (who had serued the empresse, was taken also at S.
Albons) but not without great slaughter of the kings souldiers: in so
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Arundell.</span>
much that among other, the erle of Arundell mounted on a couragious
palfrie &amp; a verie valiant man was ouerthrowen the middest of a water
called Haliwell, by a knight named Walkeline de Orcaie, so that same
earle was sore bruised in his bodie, and almost drowned. The king was
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paru.</i></span>
present himselfe at the taking of the said Mandeuile, whom he spoiled of
all his goods, and constreined by way of redemption of his libertie, to
deliuer into the kings hands the Tower of London, the castell of Walden,
and Pleshey. Here vpon the same earle being released was driuen through
pouertie to seeke some recouerie of his losses by sundrie spoiles and
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;9. <br />
1144.</span>
roberies. First of all therefore he spoiled the abbeie of S. Albons, and
then the abbeie of Ramsey, which he fortified and defended as a
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hen.&nbsp;Hunt.</i></span>
fortresse, casting the moonks out of doores, and in euerie place where
soeuer he came, he robbed the countrie before him, till at length in the
midst of his reuenge and malicious dooings, he was shot thorough with an
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" ></a><span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
arrow amongst his men by a sillie footman, and so ended his life with
<span class="rightnote"><i>Sim.&nbsp;Dunel.</i> <i>Iohn&nbsp;Pike.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i> <i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
confusion, receiuing worthie punishment for his vngodlie behauiour. For
he was a man of high stomach &amp; loftie courage, but verie obstinate
against God, of great industrie in worldlie businesse, but passing
negligent towards his maker, as writers report of him.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Malm.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paru.</i></span>
Likewise Robert Marmion, who had attempted the semblable robberie &amp;
spoile in the abbeie church of Couentrie, was slain before the same
abbeie by a like mischance. For going foorth to encounter with the earle
of Chester (his mortall enimie, and being approched as then towards the
citie) he fell with his horsse into a ditch, which he caused to be
couertlie made for the destruction of his enimies: and before he could
be relieued, a souldier of the earles part stept to him, and stroke his
head from his shoulders in sight of both armies. Ernulfus the sonne of
earle Geffrey Mandeuile that kept the church of Ramsey as a fortresse,
after his fathers death, was taken at length and banished.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Thus we see how Gods iudgement hunteth and pursueth the wicked, in
somuch that they be ouertaken in their owne imaginations: according to
that of the scripture, "The wicked and bloudthirstie man shall not liue
halfe his daies." And true it is, that as men liue, so commonlie they
die: for, as one saith verie well:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>About the same time aduertisement was giuen, that the citie of Lincolne,
which the earle of Chester had in keeping, was but slenderlie manned.
Wherevpon the king conceiuing some hope to win the same, hasted forward:
<span class="rightnote">Lincolne besieged.</span>
and comming thither in the night, laid siege therevnto, and began to
cast a trench to stop them within fr&#333; making any salies without.</p>

<p>The earle at the first being somewhat amazed with the sudden approch of
the enimie, yet beholding from the walles the maner of them without, he
perceiued the rankes to be verie thin: and thereby gessing their number
<span class="rightnote">The siege raised.</span>
to be but small, suddenlie issued foorth at the gates to encounter with
them. The king abode not the giuing of the charge, bicause he was but
weake and therefore fled; neither could the earle follow the chace
conuenientlie, for the like cause; but setting vpon those that were
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
about to make the trench, he slue 80. of the workmen, and then retired
into the castell.</p>

In the yeare following; namelie, in the 10. yeare of king Stephans
reigne, Robert earle of Glocester and other capteins took in hand to
build a castell at Faringdon. But King Stephan assembling an armie of
Londoners and other, came thither, and besieged them within. Now whilest
earle Robert and others of the empresses capteins remaining not far off,
taried for a greater power to come to their aid, the king with sharpe
assaults (but not without losse of his men) wan the fortresse: whereby
his side began to wax the stronger, and to be more highlie aduanced.
After this he came with a mightie armie vnto Wallingford, and there
builded a strong castell ouer against the other castell which his
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;11. <br />

aduersaries held against him.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
Thither also came the earle of Chester with a great traine of knights
and gentlemen vnto the king, and so at length they were not vnfeignedlie
accorded and made freends, but in apperance on the kings behalfe. For
shortlie after, the earle was craftilie taken at a parlement holden at
Northampton, by the practise of K. Stephan, and could not be deliuered
till he had surrendred the citie and castell of Lincolne, with other
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> The welshmen waste Cheshire. <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
fortresses perteining to the crowne into the kings hands. About that
time did the Welshmen destroie the prouince of Chester, but at last they
were distressed. This yeare also the loard Geffrey earle of Aniou sent
thr&eacute;e Noble men into England, accompanied with certeine men of warre,
vnto earle Robert, requesting him to send ouer his sonne Henrie into
France, that he might s&eacute;e him, and if need required, he promised to send
him backe againe with all conuenient speed. Earle Robert was contented
to satisfie his
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" ></a><span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
request: and so with a good power of armed men brought
the lord Henrie vnto Warham, where he tooke leaue of him, neuer after to
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Glocester departeth this life.</span>
s&eacute;e him in this world. For when the child was transported, earle Robert
returned sp&eacute;edilie to the parties from whence he came, and there falling
into an ague, departed this life about the beginning of Nouember, and
was buried at Bristow. The lord Henrie comming to his father, was
ioifully receiued, and remained in those parties for the space of two
yeares and foure moneths.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;12. <br />
1147.</span>
In the meane season, the vniust proc&eacute;edings of K. Stephan against the
earle of Chester, purchased him new hatred of his old aduersaries, and
like supicion of such as were his freends, for it sounded not a little
to his dishonor. Euerie man therefore was in doubt of his dealing, and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> K. Stephen entreth into Lincolne with his crowne
on his head.</span>
iudged that it stood them vpon to take h&eacute;ed to themselues. But he (as
one that thought he had atchiued some high exploit) in triumphant wise
shortlie after entred into Lincolne in his roiall robes, and his crowne
on his head, whereas it had not b&eacute;ene heard that any king had doone the
like manie yeares before.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;It is reported by some writers, that he did this, to root out of mens
minds a foolish superstitious conceit, which bel&eacute;eued that no king with
his crowne vpon his head might enter that citie, but some mischance
should light vpon him: wherevpon he seemed by this meanes to mocke their
superstitious imagination.</p>

<p>About the same time manie of the Nobles of the realme (perceiuing the
kings authoritie to represse violent wrongs committed by euill dooers to
be defectiue) builded sundrie strong castels and fortresses vpon their
owne grounds, either to defend themselues, or to make force vpon their
enimies n&eacute;ere adioining. After the departing of the king from Lincolne,
the earle of Chester came thither with an armie, to assaie if he might
recouer that citie. But his lieutenant that had the leading of his men,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i></span>
was slaine at the entring of the northgate, and so the erle was beaten
backe with the losse of manie of his men: and the citizens hauing got
the vpper hand, reioised not a little for the victorie.</p>

<p>But here (to staie a litle with temporall affaires) it shall not be
amisse to rehearse the effect of a contention, which fell about this
time betw&eacute;ene that king and the archbishop of Canturburie. For so it
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
happened (as Geruasius Dorobernensis writeth) that pope Eugenius came
this yere into France, about the middest of Lent, and afterward held a
synod or councell at Rhemes: wherevnto Theobald archbishop of
Canturburie, with others of the English bishops were summoned. The
archbishop therevpon asking licence of the king, &amp; not obteining it,
found meanes to steale awaie in a small bote, not without danger of his
person.</p>

<p>Now therefore the case of this Theobald stood verie hard: for Henrie
bishop of Winchester the kings brother through enuie had so wrought,
that if the archbishop passed ouer without licence, he should be
confined of the king. Againe, he was sure, if he came not to the
councell, that he should be suspended by the pope. Herevpon the
archbishop meaning rather to offend the king than the pope, got ouer, as
it were swimming, rather than sailing; the vessell wherein he passed
ouer being starke naught: for all the ports were kept by the kings
seruants, so that he was glad to take such a bote as came next to hand.
In consideration whereof he was highlie commended by the pope.</p>

<p>In this councell the prebendaries of Yorke, togither with Henrie Mordach
then abbat of Fountney, presented themselues, exhibiting their complaint
against William archbishop of Yorke, for that (as they alledged) he was
neither canonicallie chosen, nor lawfullie consecrated, but intruded by
the kings authoritie. At length archbishop William was conuicted and
deposed, Albert bishop of Hostia pronouncing sentence in this wise: "We
doo decr&eacute;e by the apostolike authoritie, that William archbishop of
Yorke is to be deposed from his s&eacute;e, bicause Stephan king of England,
before any canonicall election, named him."</p>

<p>Then, for that pope Eugenius had thus deposed archbishop William,
although not with
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" ></a><span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
the consent of the more part of the cardinals, the
chapiter of the church of Yorke, by his commandement comming togither,
part of them chose Hilarie bishop of Chichester, and the other part
elected Henrie Mordach abbat of Fountney. Now pope Eugenius, when both
elections were shewed him at Auxerre, confirmed the election of Henrie
Mordach, and disanulled the other, and then consecrated the foresaid
Henrie with his owne hands. The late nominated archbishop William being
thus deposed, returned into England, and remained at Winchester with
king Henrie till the death of pope Eugenius, following the counsell of
the same bishop in all things.</p>

<p>Now when the councell at Rhemes was ended, archbishop Theobald returned
into England, and comming to Canturburie, was receiued with great honor,
of the couent and citizens there. But the king remaining then at London,
when he heard of it, was sore displeased, and came with great sp&eacute;ede
vnto Canturburie, where much conference being had betwixt him and the
archbishop (although to small purpose) for the bringing of them to an
agr&eacute;ement, at length the king compelled the archbishop to depart the
realme. Wherevpon, after a few daies respit, he went to Douer, where he
tooke ship and sailed into France. But within a while he was called
backe by the qu&eacute;ene and William of Ypres, vnto S. Omers, that they might
the sooner aduertise him of the kings mind and pleasure. Here he
consecrated Gilbert the elect bishop of Hereford, the fift daie of
September, Theodoric bishop of Amiens, and Nicholas bishop of Cambre
assisting him.</p>

<p>After this, when by sending of messengers to and fro, as well bishops,
abbats, and other, both spirituall persons and temporall, there could no
agr&eacute;ement be made, he directed his letter to certeine churches here in
England, pronouncing by a certeine day, namelie the twelfe day of
September, a sentence of interdiction to be obserued through the relme.
The monks of Canturburie sore offended herewith, before the prefixed day
of this sentence to be put in vse, sent two moonkes of their owne house,
Nigell and Absolon, vnto the pope: whose errand when the pope had
vnderstood, he commanded them to returne home, and to obeie their
archbishops sentence in all things.</p>

<p>In the meane time, the archbishops men and tenants were sore oppressed,
and his rents and reuenues seized to the kings vse, yea euen before the
daies of paiment. Which maner of proceeding sore gr&eacute;eued the archbishop:
in so much that departing from S. Omers, he came to Graueling, and there
taking the sea, crossed ouer to a towne called Goseford that belonged
vnto Hugh Bigot erle of Northfolke: which earle receiued him with great
honor, and sent him all necessarie prouision, so long as he remained in
his countrie. At the terme appointed, he interdicted all the kings
dominions, and would not reuoke the sentence, till Robert bishop, of
London, Hilarie bishop of Chichester, and William bishop of Norwhich,
with manie other Noblemen, came to him vnto Framelingham in Norfolke, a
castell apperteining to the said earle, where at length an attonment was
concluded betwixt him and the king: wherevpon he was brought home vnto
Canturburie with great ioy and honor.</p>

<p>He accused the moonks of Canturburie, for disobeieng the interdiction,
trusting that the pope would not heare those two moonkes whom they had
sent, as he did not ind&eacute;ed. He excommunicated also all those that had
receiued the sacraments amongst them, during the time of the
interdiction. Now these moonkes being at their wits end, dispatched with
all speed other two moonkes to the pope, to obteine an absolution,
before the archbishop should vnderstand it: but they were sent backe
againe with checks and commanded to obeie their archbishop in all
<span class="rightnote"><i>Geruasius.</i></span>
things, as the other were, which had b&eacute;ene there with him before.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;13. <br />
1148.</span>
The moonks of Canturburie that were sent to Rome, returning, came from
thence to Bullongne, where they found those that were first sent
thither: and so they all foure came to Canturburie. The pope also had
sent a priuie commandement to the archbishop that he should duelie
punish as well them as the other. Wherevpon the archbishop
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" ></a><span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
taking
counsell with his fr&eacute;ends, deposed Syluester the prior, and suspended
William the secretarie of the house from entring the qu&eacute;ere. It was
decreed also, that the residue should cease so long a time from saieng
seruice, as they had said it before vnlawfullie, against the archbishops
commandement. For it was thought reason, that whilest other sang and
were merrie, they should keepe silence, which wilfullie tooke vpon them
to sing, whilest other held their peace and were still. They began
therefore to cease from saieng diuine seruice, and from ringing their
bels in the second w&eacute;eke of Lent &amp; so kept silence from the twelfe day
of March, vntill the first daie of August.</p>

<p>The qu&eacute;ene wife to king Stephan in this meane while lay much at S.
Augustines in Canturburie, bicause of hastening forward the building of
Feuersham abbeie, which she and hir husband had begonne from the verie
foundation. And bicause the moonkes of S. Augustine might not celebrate
diuine seruice, she called thither commonlie the moonks of Christes
church to say seruice before hir. Thus much for that purpose: and now to
other matters.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The L. Henrie returneth into England.</span>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;14. <br />
1149.</span>
The lord Henrie Fitzempresse after all these businesses returned into
England, in the moneth of May, with a great companie of men of warre
both horssemen and footmen: by reason whereof many reuolted from king
Stephan to take part with him: whereas before they sat still, and would
not attempt any exploit against him. But now incouraged with the
presence of the lord Henrie, they declared themselues freends to him,
and enimies to the king. Immediatlie after his arriuall, he tooke with
him the earles of Chester and Hereford, Ranulfe and Roger, and diuers
other Noble men and knights of great fame, beside those whom he had
brought with him out of Normandie, and went vnto Carleil, where he found
his coosin Dauid king of Scotland, of whome he was most ioifullie
receiued; and vpon Whitsunday with great solemnitie, being not past
<span class="rightnote">He is made knight. <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
sixt&eacute;ene yeares of age, was by the same king made knight, with diuerse
other yoong gentlemen that were much about the same age.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Some write, that the king of Scots receiued an oth of him before he
gaue him the honor of knighthood, that if he chanced to atteine vnto the
possession of the realme of England, he should restore to the Scots the
towne of Newcastle, with the countrie of Northumberland, from the riuer
of Tw&eacute;ed, to the riuer of Tine. But whether it were so or not, I am not
able to make warrantize.</p>

<p>Now king Stephan hearing that the king of Scots, and his aduersarie the
lord Henrie with the ch&eacute;efest lords of the west parts of England lay
<span class="rightnote">K. Stephan with an armie commeth to Yorke.</span>
thus in Carleil, he raised an armie, and came to the citie of Yorke,
where he remained for the most part of the moneth of August, fearing
least his enimies should attempt the winning of that citie. But after
the one part had remained a time in Carleil, and the other in Yorke,
they departed from both those places without any further exploit for
that season, sauing that Eustachius king Stephans sonne (hauing also
latelie receiued the order of knighthood) did much hurt in the countries
which belonged to those Noble men that were with the lord Henrie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i>. Great raine.</span>
The great raine that fell in the summer season this yeare did much hurt
vnto corne standing on the ground, so that a great dearth followed. In
the winter also after, about the tenth day of December, it began to

fr&eacute;ese extreamelie, and so continued till the nineteenth of Februarie:
whereby the riuer of Thames was so frosen, that men might passe ouer it

In the meane while Henrie Duke of Normandie, after he had returned from
the king of the Scots, sailed backe into Normandie, about the beginning
of August, leauing England full of all those calamities, which ciuill
warre is accustomed to bring with it, as burning of houses, killing,
robbing, and spoiling of people, so that the land was in danger of vtter
destruction, by reason of that pestilent discord.</p>

But king Stephan assaulting the faire citie of Worcester with a great
power of men tooke it, and consumed it with fire, but the castell he
could not win. This citie belonged to earle Waleran de Mellent, at that
season: for king Stephan to his owne hinderance had giuen it vnto him.
Now after the men of warre had diuided the spoile amongst them, they
came backe, and passing through the lands of their enimies, got great

In the yeare following Theobald archbishop of Canturburie, and legat to

the s&eacute;e apostolike, held a generall synod or councell at London in the
Lent season, where king Stephan himselfe with his sonne Eustachius, and
other the peers of the realme were present. This councell was full of
appeales, contrarie to that had beene vsed in this land, till the time
that Henrie bishop of Winchester vnto his owne harme (whilest he was
likewise the Popes legat) had by vniust intrusion brought them in, and
now at this councell he was himselfe thrise appealed to the hearing of
the popes owne consistorie. After this king Stephan in the same yeare
brake into the citie of Worcester, and whereas he could not the last
time win the castell, he now endeauoured with all his force to take it.
But when those within made valiant resistance, he raised two castels
against it, and leauing in the same certeine of his Nobles to continue
the siege, he himselfe returned home. &para;&nbsp;Thus (as yee see) the kings
propertie was to attempt manie things valiantlie, but he proc&eacute;eded in
them oftentimes verie slowlie: howbeit, now by the policie of the earle
of Leicester, those two castels which the king had raised to besiege the
other castell, were shortlie after destroied: and so the besieged were

In the meane while Henrie duke of Normandie maried Elianor duches of

right of hir he became duke of Aquitaine, and earle of Poictou; for she
was the onelie daughter to William duke of Guien, and earle of Poictou,
and by hir father created his sole and lawfull heire.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The French king maketh warre against the duke of Normandie.</span>
The French king was nothing pleased with this mariage, in somuch that he
made sore warre vpon duke Henrie, ioining himselfe in league with king
Stephan, with his sonne Eustace, and with the lord Geffrey brother to
duke Henrie, so that the said Henrie was constreined to defer his
iournie into England, and applie his power to defend his countries and
subiects on that side of the sea. For whereas he was readie at the mouth
of the riuer of Barbe to passe ouer into England, not long after
midsummer, the French king, with Eustace king Stephans sonne, Robert
erle of Perch, Henrie erle of Champaigne, and Geffrey brother to duke
Henrie, hauing assembled a mightie armie, came and besieged the castell
of Newmarch, and sent foorth the lord Geffrey with a strong power to win

besieged, but the castell of Newmarch was deliuered to the French king
through treason of those that had it in k&eacute;eping, before the duke could
come to their rescue.</p>

<p>Wherevpon the said duke hauing knowledge by the waie that he should come
too late thither, he encamped first vpon the side of the riuer of
Andell, and wasted
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" ></a><span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Ueulquesine or Ueuxin.</span>
a great part of the countrie of Ueuxin or
Ueulquesine, surnamed Le Normant, which lieth betwixt the riuer of Epte
and Andell. This countrie belonged sometime to Normandie, but Geffrey
earle of Aniou the dukes father had resigned it to the French king, to
the end he should not aid king Stephan. The duke also burned the castels
of Bascheruille, Chitrey, Stripiney, and the castell of Fort, that
belonged to Hugh de Gourney, with diuerse other. About the end of August
he left his townes in Normandie sufficientlie furnished with garisons of
souldiers, and went into Aniou, where he besieged the castell de mount
Sotelli, till he had taken it, and all those that were within it,
amongst whome was the lord thereof named William. The French king on the

<p>Whilest these things were thus a dooing in France, K. Stephan would haue
caused the archbishop of Canturburie &amp; diuerse other bishops, whom for
that purpose he had assembled, to crowne, annoint, and confirme his
sonne Eustace king ouer the realme of England. But the archbishops and
<span class="rightnote">The Pope is against it.</span>
bishops refused so to doo, bicause the pope by his letters sent to the
archbishop, had commanded to the contrarie; namelie, that he should in
no wise crowne the kings sonne, bicause his father king Stephan had got
the possession of the land against his oth receiued in behalfe of the
empresse. The father and sonne being not a litle offended herewith,
<span class="rightnote">The bishops are threatened.</span>
committed most of his bishops to ward s&eacute;eking by threats and menacings
to bring them to his purpose. The bishops also were in no small
perplexitie: for according to the truth, the king neuer seemed greatlie
to fauor churchmen, bicause of their strength (as in former times by his
rigor vsed against the bishops of Salisburie and Lincolne it plainelie
appeared) and yet would not these men y&eacute;eld to his pleasure: wherevpon

to Malmesburie, where in the castell was a great garison of soldiers
<span class="rightnote">He besiegeth the castell of Malmesburie. <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i>
<i>Polydor.</i></span>
placed by king Stephan. Duke Henrie planted his siege about this castell
the thirt&eacute;enth daie of Januarie, and enforced himselfe to the vttermost
of his power to win it.</p>

<p>Now king Stephan hearing of his enimies arriuall, with all hast possible
got his armie on foot, and comming suddenlie towards the place where is
<span class="rightnote">K. Stephan constreineth him to raise his siege.</span>
enimies were pitched, he caused duke Henrie to raise his siege, and
following after, offered him battell. But duke Henrie, knowing that his
enimies were far more in number than he was at that present, and also
conceiuing with himselfe that by prolonging of time his owne power would
increase, absteined from fighting, and kept him within the closure of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paru.</i></span>
his campe. &para;&nbsp;Thus haue some written, but other authors write, that
Henrie kept himselfe indeed within his campe, and refused to giue
battell, but yet remoued not his siege, till the king departed from
thence, after he saw he could not haue his purpose, and then did duke
Henrie win the castell of Malmesburie, or rather the maister tower or
<span class="rightnote"><i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
ch&eacute;efe dungeon of that castell. For as (Simon of Durham writeth) he had
won by assault the other parts and lims of the castell before king
Stephan came to remoue him.</p>

<p>This tower that thus held out, was in the keeping of one capteine
Jordan, who escaping foorth came to the king, informing him in what
state he had left his men within the tower: wherevpon the king (making
all the power that he was able) set forward, and comming to Circiter,
lodged there one night, and in the morning purposing to raise the siege,
or to fight with his enimies (if they would abide battell) marched
<span class="rightnote">A sore storm.</span>
foorth towards Malmesburie. But vpon his approch to the dukes campe, the
daie following his comming thither, there rose such a hideous tempest of
wind and raine, beating full in the faces of king Stephans people, that
God seemed to fight for the duke, who in respect of the number of people
was thought too weake to deale with the strong and puissant armie of the
king: howbeit the storme being on his backe, and beating extremelie in
king Stephans mens faces, they were not able to hold their weapons in
their hands, in somuch that he perceiued he could not passe the riuer
that ran betwixt the armies: wherevpon constreined in that sort through
the violent rage of that cold and wet weather, he returned to London
full euill appaied, in that he could not satisfie his expectation at
that present.</p>

<p>The tower that duke Henrie had hardlie besieged immediatlie herewith was
surrendred vnto him, &amp; then making prouision for vittels and other
<span class="rightnote">The castell of Wallingford.</span>
things, to the reliefe of them that kept the castell of Wallingford, he
hasted thither, and finding no resistance by the way, easily
accomplished his enterprise. There were diuerse castels thereabouts in
the countrie furnished with garisons of the kings souldiers, but they
<span class="rightnote">The castell of Cranemers. </span>
kept themselues close, and durst not come abroad to stop his passage.
Shortlie after he besieged the castell of Cranemers, and cast a trench
about it, so as his people within Wallingford castell
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" ></a><span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
might haue free
libertie to come foorth at their pleasure: but as for those within the
castell of Cranemers, they were so hardlie holden in, that there was no
waie for them to start out.</p>

<p>The king aduertised hereof, got all his host togither, and marched
forward verie terriblie toward duke Henries campe. But shewing no token
of feare, he caused the trench wherewith he had inclosed his campe
foorthwith to be cast downe, and leauing the siege, came into the fields
with his armie set in order of battell, meaning to trie the matter by
dint of sword, although he had not the like number of men as the king
had: whose armie perceiuing their enimies to come in the face of them,
were stricken with a sudden feare: neuerthelesse, he himselfe being of a
good courage, commanded his people to march forward. But herewith
certeine Noble men, that loued not the aduancement of either part, vnder
a colour of good meaning sought to treat an agr&eacute;ement betwixt them, so
that an intermission or cesing from war was granted, and by composition
the castell which the king had built, and the duke besieged, was razed
to the ground. The king and the duke also came to an interuiew and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> Eustace king Stephans sonne.</span>
communication togither, a riuer running betwixt them. Some write that
they fell to agreement, king Stephan vndertaking to raze the castell of
Cranemers himselfe, and so laieng armour aside for that time, they
parted asunder.</p>

<p>But Eustace K. Stephans son was sore offended herewith, and reprouing
his father for concluding such an agr&eacute;ement, in a great rage departed
from the court, &amp; taking his waie toward Cambridgeshire (which countrie
he meant to ouerrun) he came to the abbeie of Burie, and vpon S.
Laurence daie caused all the corne in the countrie about and namelie
that which belonged to the said abbeie, to be spoiled and brought into a
castell which he had in keeping not far from thence. But as he sat downe
<span class="rightnote">Eustace king Stephans son and Simon earl of North&#257;pton
depart this life both in one w&eacute;eke.</span>
to meat the same daie vpon receiuing the first morsell he fell mad (as
writers haue reported) and miserablie ended his life. The same weeke
Simon earle of Northampton departed this world of a like disease, and so
two of the cheefest aduersaries which duke Henrie had, were rid out of
the waie. Eustace was buried at Feuersham in Kent, and earle Simon at
Northampton.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Chester deceasseth.</span>
About the same time also that noble and valiant earle of Chester called
Ranulfe departed this life, a man of such stoutnesse of stomach, that
death could scarselie make him to yeeld, or shew any token of feare: he
was poisoned (as was thought) by William Peuerell. After him succeeded
his sonne Hugh, a man likewise of passing strength and vertue. Now
although earle Ranulfe fauoured the part of duke Henrie, yet in these
later yeares he did but little for him: wherefore it was thought that
the death of this earle was not so great a losse to the duke, as the
deaths of Eustace, earle Simon, and other the kings fr&eacute;ends deceasing
about the same time seemed to further him: so that his part became
dailie stronger, and the kings weaker.</p>

<p>About the same time the castels of Reading and B&eacute;ertwell were deliuered
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Par.</i> <i>Rob.&nbsp;Mont.</i></span>
to duke Henrie, and the ladie Gundreda countesse of Warwike draue out
the souldiers that held it for king Stephan, and deliuered the towne to
duke Henrie. In this yeare duches Elenor, wife to Henrie Fitzempresse,
was brought to bed of hir first borne son, whom they named William,
after the maner of the ancient dukes of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>Thus came things to passe in sundrie places with so good successe as
duke Henrie could wish, wherevpon meaning to follow the steps of
<span class="rightnote">Stamford was taken. <i>Simon&nbsp;Dun.</i> <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> Gipswich or
Ipswich besieged.</span>
prosperous fortune, he marched foorth to Stamford, and taking the towne
at his first comming laid siege to the castell. Now they that had it in
keeping sent messengers to king Stephan, requiring rescue, but the same
time he had laid siege to the castell of Gipswich, which Hugh Bigot kept
against him: and bicause he wold not depart from that siege till he had
the castell giuen vp into his hands (which came at last to passe) in the
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
meane time the castell of Stamford was y&eacute;elded vp to duke Henrie, who
immediatelie therevpon departed from Stamford eastward, meaning to come
to the succour of his fr&eacute;ends besieged at Gipswich or Ipswich
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" ></a><span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
(as it is
commonlie called) not vnderstanding as yet that they had surrendred the
hold: but hauing knowledge by the way what was happened, he returned and
<span class="rightnote">Notingh&agrave;m.</span>
marched streight to Notingham, and got the towne easilie; for they
within the castell had set it on fire, therefore he besieged the castell
standing vpon the point of a st&eacute;epe craggie rocke, and was furnished
with a strong garison of men, and all things necessarie for defense, so
that it could not easilie be woone.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Duke Henrie raiseth his siege from Notingham. <i>Polydor.</i></span>
When duke Henrie had assaied all the waies how to take it, and saw that
he could not preuaile, he minded to loose no more time: but raising his
siege from thence, he ranged abroad to get other places into his
possession, and finallie came to his mother, and laie at Wallingford. K.
Stephan in the meane time being strong in the field, sought time and
place to haue Henrie at some aduantage, who in his yoong yeares (as yet
not hauing tasted any misfortune) he thought would rashlie attempt some
<span class="rightnote">The miserie of this land in time of the ciuill warre.</span>
vnaduised enterprise. &para;&nbsp;But whereas the realme of England had b&eacute;ene now
manie yeares miserablie turmoiled with ciuill warre (which the verie
heathen haue so detested, that they haue exclaimed against it with a
kind of irksomnesse; as:</p>

<p class="nogap">Wherein (besides millians of extremities) honest matrones and mens wiues
were violated, maids and virgins rauished, churches spoiled, townes and
villages robbed, whole flocks and heards of sh&eacute;epe and beasts destroied
(wherein the substance of the realme cheeflie consisted) and men without
number slaine and murthered, it pleased the goodnesse of almightie God
at length to deliuer the land of these miseries, which were notified to
all countries round about that sore lamented the same.</p>

<p>Now whereas king Stephan was the cause of all the troubles, in hauing
vsurped an other mans rightfull inheritance, it pleased God to mooue his
hart at length to desire peace which he had euer before abhorred. The
cause that mooued him ch&eacute;efelie to change his former purpose, was for
that his sonne Eustace by speedie death was taken out of this world (as
before ye haue heard) which losse s&eacute;emed great not onelie to the father,
but also to all those lords and others which had alwaies taken his part,
bicause he was a yoong man so well liked of all men, that he was iudged
<span class="rightnote">The ladie Constance wife to Eustace sent home.</span>
to be borne to much honour. But his wife Constance tooke his death verie
sorowfullie, and the more indeed for that she had no issue by him,
wherevpon shortlie after she was sent honourablie home to hir father
king Lewes with hir dower, and other rich and princelie gifts.</p>

<p>King Stephan s&eacute;eing himselfe thus depriued of his onelie sonne, vnto
whome he minded to leaue the kingdome which he so earnestlie sought to
confirme and assure vnto him by warlike endeuor, and that againe the
French kings aid would not be so readie as heretofore it had b&eacute;ene
(wherevpon he much staied, now that the bonds of affinitie were
abolished) he began at length (though not immediatlie vpon his sonnes
<span class="rightnote">K. Stephan began to incline his mind to peace.
<i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
deceasse) to withdraw his mind from war, and bequeathed it wholie to
peace. Which alteration being perceiued, those Nobles that were glad to
s&eacute;e the state of their countrie quieted, did their best to further it; &amp;
ch&eacute;eflie Theobald archbishop of Canturburie trauelled earnestlie to
bring the princes to some agr&eacute;ement, now talking with the king, now
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
sending to the duke, and vsing all meanes possible to set them at
vnitie. The bishop of Winchester also, who had caused all the trouble,
vpon consideration of the great calamities wherewith the land was most
miserablie afflicted, began to wish an end thereof. Wherevpon
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" ></a><span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
the lords
spirituall and temporall were called togither at Winchester about the
latter end of Nouember, that they with their consents also might
confirme whatsoeuer the king and the duke should conclude vpon.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">An assemblie of lords at Winchester. A peace concluded
betwixt the king and the duke.</span>
Thus was a publike assemblie made in the citie of Winchester, whither
also duke Henrie came who being ioifullie receiued of the king in the
bishops palace, they were made fr&eacute;ends, the king admitting the duke for
his sonne, and the duke the king for his father, insomuch that the
agreement, which (through the carefull sute of the archbishop of
Canturburie) had beene laboured with such diligence to good effect, was
now confirmed: the cheefe articles whereof were these.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Some writers haue recorded that duke Henrie should presentlie
by this agr&eacute;ement enioy halfe the realme of England.</span>
1 That king Stephan, during his naturall life, should remaine king of
England, and Henrie the empresses sonne should enioy the dukedome of
Normandie, and be proclaimed heire apparant to succ&eacute;ed in and haue the
regiment of England, after the deceasse of Stephan.</p>

<p>2 That such noble men, and other, which had held either with the one
partie or the other, during the time of the ciuill warres, should be in
no danger for the same but enioy their lands, possessions and liuings,
according to their ancient rights and titles.</p>

<p>3 That the king should resume and take into his hands againe, all such
portions and parcels of inheritance belonging to the crowne, as he had
giuen away, or were otherwise vsurped by any maner of person, and that
all those possessions which by any intrusion had b&eacute;ene violentlie taken
from the right owners, since the daies of king Henrie, should be
restored to them that were rightlie possessed in the same by the daies
of the said king.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Castels to be razed in number. 1115.</span>
4 That all those castels, which contrarie to all reason and good order
had b&eacute;ene made and builded by any maner of person in the daies of king
Stephan, should be ouerthrowne and cast downe, which were found to be
eleuen hundred and fifteene.</p>

<p>5 That the king should reforme all such disorders as warre had brought
in; to restore farmers to their holdings, to repaire decaied buildings,
to restore pastures and leassues with cattell, hils with sheepe, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6 That by his meanes the cleargie might enioy their due quietnesse, and
not be oppressed with any vniust exactions.</p>

<p>7 That he should place shirifes where they had b&eacute;ene accustomed to beare
rule, with instructions giuen them to deale vprightlie in causes, so as
offenders might not escape through bribes, or any other respect of
freendship; but that euerie man might receiue according to right and
equitie.</p>

<p>8 That soldiours should conuert their swords (as Esaie saith) into
culters &amp; plough shares, their speares into mattocks, and so returne
from the campe to the plough: and that such as were woont to keepe watch
in the night season, might now sl&eacute;epe and take their rest without any
danger.</p>

<p>9 That the husbandman might be set fr&eacute;e from all trouble and vexation,
by meanes wherof he might follow his tilth, and plie his culture.</p>

<p>10 That merchant men and occupiers might enioy their trades and
occupations to their aduancement.</p>

<p>11 That one kind and manner of siluer coine should run through the land,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>12 There was also consideration had of a sonne which king Stephan had,
named William, who though he were verie yoong, was yet appointed to
sweare fealtie vnto duke Henrie as lawfull heire to the crowne. The same
William had the citie of Norwhich, and diuerse other lands assigned him
for the maintenance of his estate, and that by the consent and agr&eacute;ement
of duke Henrie his adopted brother.</p>
</div>

<p>These things being thus concluded at Winchester, and the warre that had
continued, for the space of 17 yeares now ended and fullie pacified: the
king tooke the duke with him to London, dooing to him all the honour he
could deuise. The newes whereof
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" ></a><span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
being spred abrode, euerie good man
reioised thereat. Thus through the great mercie of God, peace was
restored vnto the decaied state of this relme of England. Which things
being thus accomplished with great ioy and tokens of loue, king Stephan
and his new adopted sonne duke Henrie tooke leaue either of other,
appointing shortlie after to m&eacute;et againe at Oxenford, there to perfect
euerie article of their agr&eacute;ement, which was thus accorded a little
before Christmas.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;But by the way, for the better vnderstanding of the said agreement, I
haue thought good to set downe the verie tenor of the charter made by
king Stephan, as I haue copied it out, and translated it into English
out of an autentike booke conteining the old lawes of the Saxon and
Danish kings, in the end whereof the same charter is exemplified, which
booke is remaining with the right worshipfull William Fl&eacute;etwood esquire,
now recorder of London, and sargeant at law.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>The charter of king Stephan, of the pacification of the troubles betwixt
him and Henrie duke of Normandie.</h3>

<p>Stephan king of England, to all archbishops, bishops, abbats, earles,
iusticers, sherifes, barons and all his faithfull subiects of England
sendeth greeting. Know yee that I king Stephan, haue ordeined Henrie
duke of Normandie after me by right of inheritance to be my successour,
and heire of the kingdome of England, and so haue I giuen and granted to
him and his heires the kingdome of England. For the which honour, gift,
and confirmation to him by me made, he hath doone homage to me, and with
a corporall oth hath assured me, that he shall be faithfull and loiall
to me, and shall to his power preserue my life and honour: and I on the
other side shall maineteine and preserue him as my sonne and heire in
all things to my power, and so far as by any waies or meanes I may.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">William sonne to king Stephan.</span>
And William my sonne hath doone his lawfull homage, and assured his
fealtie vnto the said duke of Normandie, and the duke hath granted to
him to hold of him all those tenements and holdings which I held before
I atteined to the possession of the realme of England, wheresoeuer the
same be in England, Normandie, or elsewhere, and whatsoeuer he receiued
<span class="rightnote">Earle Warren.</span>

put my sonne William and his men that are of that honour in full
possession and seizine of all the lands, boroughs and rents, which the
duke thereof now hath in his demaine, and namelie of those that belong
to the honour of the earle Warren, and namelie of the castels of

Bellencumber and Mortimer, so that Reginald de Warren shall haue the

also which I haue giuen vnto my sonne William, he hath likewise granted
<span class="rightnote">Norwich. </span>

An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;19.</span>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
Thus far the Charter: and now to proceed with the historie. Immediatlie
after Christmasse, euen in the Octaues of the Epiphanie, the king and
duke Henrie met againe Oxenford, where all the earls and barons of the
land being assembled, sware fealtie vnto duke Henrie, their allegiance
due vnto king Stephan, as to their souereigne lord and supreme gouernour
so long as he liued, alwaies reserued. The forme of the peace was now
also ingrossed and registered for a perpetuall witnesse of the thing, in
this yeare 1154. after their account that begin the yeare at
Christmasse, as about the feast of S. Hilarie in Januarie commonlie
called the twentith daie. Thus was Henrie the sonne of the empresse made
the adopted sonne of king Stephan, and therevpon the said Henrie saluted
him as king, and named him father. After conclusion of this peace, by
the power of almightie God, all debate ceassed in such wise, that the
state of the realme of England did maruelouslie for a time flourish,
concord being mainteined on ech hand. &para;&nbsp;There be which affirme, that an
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
other cause bound king Stephan to agr&eacute;e to this attonement chiefelie,
namelie for that the empresse (as they saie) was rather king Stephans
paramour than his enimie: and therefore (when she saw the matter growne
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Egelaw heath.</span>
to this point, that they were readie to trie battell with their armies
readie ranged on a plaine in the westerne parts called Egelaw heath) she
came secretlie vnto king Stephan, &amp; spake unto him on this wise: "What a
<span class="rightnote">The words of the empresse to K. Stephan.</span>
mischieuous and vnnaturall thing go ye about? Is it m&eacute;et that the father
should destroie the sonne? Is it lawfull for the sonne to kill the
father? For the loue of God (man) refraine thy displeasure, and cast thy
weapons out of thy hand, sith that (as thou thy selfe knowest full well)
<span class="rightnote">The empresse confesseth hir selfe to be naught of hir bodie.</span>
Henrie is thine owne sonne." With these and the like words she put him
in mind, and couertlie told him, that he had to doo with hir a little
before she was maried vnto earle Geffrey.</p>

<p>The king by such tokens as the empresse gaue him, tooke hir words to be
true, and therevpon all his malice was streightwaies quenched: so that
calling foorth the archbishop of Canturburie, he vttered to him the
whole matter, and tooke therewith such direction, in sending to his
aduersaries for auoiding battell at that present, that immediatlie the
armies on both sides wrapped vp their ensignes, and euery man was
commanded to k&eacute;epe the peace, that a communication might be had about
the conclusion of some pacification, which afterwards ensued in maner
aboue mentioned.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" ></a><span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
&para;&nbsp;But whether this or some other cause moued the king to this peace, it
is to be thought that God was the worker of it. And surelie a man may
thinke it good reason, that the report of such secret companie-keeping
<span class="rightnote">Slanders deuised by malicious heads.</span>
betwixt the king and the empresse, was but a tale made among the common
people vpon no ground of truth, but vpon some slanderous deuice of a
malicious head. And admit that king Stephan had to doo hir; yet is it
like that both of them would doo for best to k&eacute;epe it secret, that no
such reproch might be imputed either to Henrie, who was taken to be
legitimate; or to his mother, whose honour thereby should not a little
be stained.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Oxenford. <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> The King and duke m&eacute;et at Dunstable.</span>
But now to the purpose. Shortlie after that the king and duke Henrie had
b&eacute;ene togither at Oxenford, where they ended all things touching the
peace &amp; concord betwixt them concluded, they met againe at Dunstable,
where some cloud of displeasure seemed to darken the bright sunshine of
the late begun loue and amitie betwixt those two mightie princes the
<span class="rightnote">Articles not performed.</span>
king and the duke. For where it was accorded (among other articles) that
all the castels which had b&eacute;ene built since the daies of the late king
Henrie for euill intents and purposes, should be razed and throwne
downe: contrarie therevnto (notwithstanding manie of them were
ouerthrowne and destroied to the accomplishment of that article) diuers
through the kings permission were suffered to stand. And when the duke
complained to the king thereof, he could not get at that time any
redresse, which somewhat troubled him: but yet bicause he would not giue
occasion of any new trouble, nor offend the king, to whom (as to his
reputed father) he would seeme to yeeld all honour and due reuerence, he
passeth it ouer.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The king and duke come to Canturburie.</span>
Within a while after, the king and he came to Canturburie, where they
were solemnlie receiued of the couent of Christes church with
procession. After this, in the Lent season they went to Douer, where
they talked with Theodorike earle of Flanders, and with the countesse
his wife who was aunt to duke Henrie. At their comming towards
Canturburie (as it was bruted) the duke should haue b&eacute;ene murthered,
<span class="rightnote">The enuie of the Flemings.</span>
through treason of the Flemings that enuied both the dukes person, and
also that peace which he had concluded with the king. But s&eacute;e the hap.
As this feat should haue b&eacute;ene wrought on Berhamdowne, William earle of
Northfolke king Stephan his sonne, who was one of the ch&eacute;efe
conspirators, fell beside his horsse, and brake his leg, so that euerie
man by that sudden chance was in a maze, &amp; came woondering about him. &para;&nbsp;This no doubt came to passe by the prouidence of God, though such
accidents are commonlie imputed to casualtie or chance medlie. For it is
the worke of God either to preuent, or to intercept, or to recompense
the vnnatural conspiracies of traitors and rebels with some notable
plague: according to that of the poet;</p>

<p>Duke Henrie herewith getting knowledge of the treason intended against
him, or at the least suspecting somewhat, got him backe againe to
Canturburie, and so auoided the danger. After this, taking his way to
<span class="rightnote">Duke Henrie passeth ouer into Normandie.</span>
Rochester, and so to London, he got him a shipboord, and sailed by long
seas into Normandie, where he arriued in safetie.</p>

<p>After his departure, king Stephan spent the summer season of this yeare,
in going about the most part of the realme; shewing all the courtesie he
could deuise to the people in all places where he came; except where he
<span class="rightnote"><i>Will&nbsp;Paru.</i> Philip de Coleuille. The castell of Drax.</span>
found any rebellious persons, as in Yorkshire, where Philip de Coleuille
(in trust of his castell which he had stronglie fortified at a certeine
place called Drax) shewed himselfe disobedient to the king, who
assembling a power in the countrie, besieged that castell, and shortlie
wanne it, without any great adoo.</p>

<p>When duke Henrie was departed (as ye haue heard) and gone ouer into
<span class="rightnote">The puissance of duke H&#275;rie.</span>
Normandie, now that he had concluded a peace with king Stephan, his
puissance was thought to be
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" ></a><span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
such, that he was able to mainteine warres
with the mightiest prince that then reigned. For in right of his wife,
he had gotten possession of the duchie of Aquitaine, and the earledome
of Poictou; and further by his mother, he enioied the duchie of
Normandie, and looked to succ&eacute;ed in the kingdome of England: and in
right of his father he was earle of Aniou, Thouraigne, and Maine. He
also reuoked into his hands certeine parcels of his demeane lands, which
his father had giuen away, and passing from thence into Aquitaine,
mightilie subdued certeine lords and barons there, that had rebelled
against him.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A peace concluded betwixt the French king and duke Henrie.
<i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i></span>
About the same time a peace was concluded betwixt the French king, and
this duke Henrie: the king restoring vnto the duke the townes of
Newmarch and Uernon, which he had before taken from him, and the duke
giuing to the king 20000. markes of siluer, for the harmes doone by him,
within the realme of France.</p>

<p>But now to returne vnto king Stephan. Yee shall vnderstand, that within
a while after he had made his foresaid progresse almost about the whole
realme, he returned vnto London, where he called a parlement as well to
consult of matters touching the state of the commonwealth, as to furnish
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paru.</i> Roger Archdeacon of Canturburie made archbishop
of Yorke.</span>
the see of Yorke with a sufficient archbishop. Wherevpon one Roger that
was before archdeacon of Canturburie, was chosen to that dignitie, and
consecrated the tenth day of October, by archbishop Theobald, as legat
to the pope, and not as archbishop of Canturburie. Then also was Thomas
Becket made
<span class="rightnote">Thomas Becket archdeacon of Canturburie.</span>
archdeacon of Canturburie by the said Theobald. The new
archbishop Roger first went to his see at Yorke, where after he had
receiued his inthronization, and set his businesse there in order, he
tooke his iournie towards Rome to fetch his pall in his owne person.</p>

<p>
King Stephan also after the end of the parlement went to Douer, there to
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Flanders.</span>
meet the earle of Flanders, who came thither to talke with him of
certeine businesse. The earle was no sooner returned backe, but the king
fell sicke, and was so gr&eacute;euouslie tormented with a paine in his bellie,
<span class="rightnote">King Stephan departed this life.</span>
and with an old disease also, wherewith (as should appear) he had beene
often troubled, namelie, the emrods, that finallie he died in the abbey
on the fiue and twentith day of October, in the nine and fortith yeare
of his age, and after he had reigned eighteene yeares, ten moneths, and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
od daies, in the yeare after the birth of our Sauiour 1154.
<span class="yearnote">1154.</span>
His bodie
was interred in the abbeie of Feuersham in Kent, which he had builded,
where his wife also, and his sonne Eustace were buried before. &para;&nbsp;Thus
farre of the acts and deeds of Stephan; now a little of other breefe
remembrances, and first touching the prosopographie or description of
his person.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">His stature.</span>
He was comelie of stature, of a verie good complexion and disposition,
of great strength, in qualities of mind verie excellent, expert in
warre, gentle, curteous, and verie liberall. For though he continued all
his time in a maner in the maintenance of wars, yet he leuied but few
tributs, or almost none at all. Ind&eacute;ed he put diuers bishops to greeuous
fines, and that not without the iust Judgement of Almightie God, that
they might so be punished duelie for their periurie committed in helping
him to the crowne. Vices wherewith he should be noted I find none, but
that vpon an ambitious desire to reigne, he brake his oth which he made
vnto the empresse Maud.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Abbeies founded. Coggeshall he founded himselfe, and Fontneis
in Lancashire, &amp; Feuersham in Kent. <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
In his daies, the abbeies of Tiltey, Fontneis, Rieualle, Coggeshall in
Essex, Newbourgh and B&eacute;eland, Meriuale in Warwikeshire, Garedon in
Leicestershire, Kirkst&eacute;ed in Yorkeshire, with diuers other in other
parts of the realme, were founded, in so much that more abbeis were
erected in his daies, than had b&eacute;ene within the space of an hundred
yeares before, as William Paruus writeth.</p>

<p>A great number of castels also were builded in his daies (as before ye
haue heard) by the Nobles of the realme, either to defend the confines
of their countries from inuasions of forrenners, and violence of
homelings; or as fortifications to themselues when they ment or intended
any inrode or breaking vpon their neighbours.</p>

<p>Diuerse learned men namelie historiographers liued in these daies, as
William Malmesburie, Henrie Huntington, Simon Dunelmensis, Galfridus
Arturius, otherwise called
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" ></a><span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
Monumetensis, Caradoc Lancarnauensis,
William Reuellensis, among whom Thurstan archbishop of Yorke is not to
be forgotten, besides many more who in diuerse sciences were verie
expert and skilfull, as by treatises of their setting f&oacute;orth to the
world hath sufficientlie appeared.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
